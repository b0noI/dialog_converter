you'll have me, after all i've done to you?
you mean, what's in that thing is immortal?
what's this?
finally, there was only one answer to a man like him--the truth--which i rose and gave to this body!  mr. president--he has told lie upon lie--every lie a desperate attempt to conceal his own guilt. and now, he is trying to blackmail this senate-- as he tried to blackmail me! to prevent his expulsion, he would probably even try to hold up this deficiency bill--vital to the whole country--which must be passed immediately--*today*! *anything*--to force you to clear his bad name and save his hide!  gentlemen--i--i have no more patience with this--this *rascally* character. i apologize to this body for his appointment--i regret i had ever known him. i--i'm sick and tired of this contemptible young man and i refuse to listen to him any longer! i hope every member of this body feels as i do!
that young lady's size, right'cher.
hey but joey, you're thinking nickels and dimes. the money's with your brother.

i think he called you beautiful.
what?  wait a minute -
why?  are you kidding me?
where is he?
now you may call it an unreasoning optimism. you may call it obtuse. but the plain fact is we still have... close to... close to...
you want to bring it down.
just one little thing. how come you were so sure manfredi and johnson wouldn't get out of the forest?
there was no way.  that cop would've gotten her to tell him... everything. she was weak and dumb...

not money.  but i appreciate your healthy cynicism in the manner. it will be wise for both of us to proceed with greatest caution.
holy mackerel! look, walter, that's what divorces are for.
nam?
the skills are still intact.  now tie his ass up, elroy.
well, sir, like i said, for the same reasons we do.  i mean, all the experts say the most likely way for war to start nowadays is by an accident, or a mistake, or by some mentally unbalanced person --

why, lord wessex! lost your wife so soon?

mr. chairman, as i understand it, the fifth amendment pertains to self-incrimination, and i can't incriminate myself because i've done nothing wrong.  besides, incrimination is why you have mr. clyde working for you.

well, why should that worry you. a soul -- a soul is nothing. can you see it, smell it, touch it? -- no! -- think of it -- this soul -- your soul -- a nothing, against seven whole years of good luck! you will have money and all that money can buy. upon my word, neighbor stone, if it weren't for my firm's reputation for generous dealing--
he laughed -- and basically said he would decide when it was over.
yeah, right.
something you did?
of course --
why, thank you travis.
are you?
no, no he's not.
well then don't pick it up. you know what's best.
what's the point of a revolution if it doesn't?
big bird touches down <u>when</u>?
they've gone to a better place.
i tell you -- he didn't do it.
go get it.
it ain't only local history, sam, it's the only murder-and-suicide case in fairvale ledgers! mrs. bates poisoned this guy she was... involved with, when she found out he was married, then took a helping of the same stuff herself.  strychnine. ugly way to die.
well tomorrow noon there's a... i got a...
no.
only five, sir. we've checked them all. he hasn't used any of them.
so how'd you get chapin to look the other way?
maybe i do.
c’mon, jack...
small brains make your balls itch?
and i could have already put clean sheets on the other bed and the fold- out. you are staying. wendy, ron and the twins are picking us up at 11:30 to go to brunch at the sheraton. they do a magnificent job there. wendy is so excited you're coming.
roald dahl. fuck me.
i'm sure you've seen this.  perhaps you knew this man under another name?
in many ways i feel as though you were my own son.
left phoenix under her own steam?
i can tell she's not a killer. you just don't like her cause you have a hang up about menstruation.
what?
well...
oh yeah? prove it.
a smaller bowl of flowers.
the first two were stabbed without thought. the sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
yeah, i know. girls mature faster than guys. but last night, i was the one who put on the brakes. and you know why?
hand me the phone.
i am a footnote in that story. i am the context for your great adventure. which never happened! incidentally! you were selling novelty products in wichita the day i was born.
exactly.
calmer than you are.
scooter, let's me and you go over to dairy queen and pick up a few things for lunchtime.
correct me if i'm wrong, but wasn't she one of the illustrious twelve?
my soul is prepared. how's yours?
halfdan wanted to stop you waking the gods... so... i disguised myself to sabotage their plans.
no.
well neither have i, but it's us or him.  if he talks, or writes a note	or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  besides, he's just a low life scumbag.  his kind is hardly even human anyway.
how far up the trail?
what?
thanks.
clark. . . !
how about magruder?
my god.  morpheus.  you gave them morpheus.
i thought you were an editor, not a reporter?
call me sonny-boy.
its not over yet.
-- oh i thought you were --
what do you want?
a day or so.
sounds all stress related. your teeth may feel sharper if you're grinding them at night. you don't seem hairy to me. is that all?
a... a  sweaty-toothed madman.
you can kiss them if you want. fell them . they're getting hard.
you gotta push the little yellow button...
whoo!
and they were usually right.
you are so full of shit
good.
you've  been there?
don't forget, the most important thing in your life is your relationship with your maker ...  don't forget to be on god's side.
do you see the kids?
no shit, come on. how you gonna do that?
no. yes, i am. i am jealous. i want to write poems about you with moonbeams, make the sea sing your name...
you're blind --
ohh!  ohh!  ohh!
of course, medical! _ 42.
what did she do?
well, you know how it is with him. always complainin' he's never turnin' a profit on st. patty's. whole damn family goes down there with no money, cause we know he can't bear ta charge us.
well, iris, i look at it this way. a lot of girls come into my cab, some of them very beautiful. and i figure all day long men have been after them: trying to touch them, talk to them, ask them out. and they hate it. so i figure the best i can do for them is not bother them at all. so i don't say a thing. i pretend i'm not even there. i figure they'll understand that and appreciate me for it.
he's right.
well, eddie catero didn't show up for work this morning... parents say he never came home last night. car's still missing.
you see--governor hopper made an appointment in this case that--well, jeff isn't exactly fitted to the work, let's say. he's here to see monuments--and pass the time. that's important to--to my work--and everybody concerned. so, someone who can be trusted has to occupy him and keep him out of trouble--
i got drunk.  i puked.  i got rejected. it was big fun.
i know who you are.  kinda out of your neighborhood, aren't you?
well perhaps better than my first. 
because you young americans think the world began when you were born. you fall apart when you don't get your own way.
so what's the problem?
we met in court.
zenovitch was about to deliver a list of names tonight – street chemists... the guys processing this p2p into speed.
am i mentoring the wrong mentee?
before the actual accident?
look, you're not gonna take shelly's camper.
and a car.
mrs. smith.
this hearing is absurd! let me tell my story...
i dunno.  he was to sound what cezanne was to image or at least i thought so.  ever since he died, i've been chased... <u>omigod</u>!
oh, no. we have dull stretches every week or so, thank god, when there's nothing to do after midnight.
oh, i wouldn't let them stop me from seeing you. so i threw them out!
no, mr. gittes. that's what i am doing with the valley. the bond issue passes tuesday. there'll be ten million to build an aqueduct and reservoir. i'm doing it.
please. you and the other elders wouldn't know what to do with these texts if your lives depended on it.  which, of course, they do.
what happened to marcus, sallah?
what did you see?
so's a noose.  now keep your mouth shut.
don't know.  i'm chasing picture books.  fuck shots, but the posers don't look like junkies.  it's well done stuff.  i thought you might have heard something.
hi, sean.
she wanted to explain about her interview, wanted to apologize to someone - and didn't dare face margo...
she's sick!
we are at least four acts short, will, if you are looking for disaster.
no, sir.
by the x. that's were two lines cross -- forming an x.
okay!
we're safe here.  i hope.  what do you think?
try?
right behind us -- dunois with another then thousand men!
alright -- i'm going to allow his testimony.
that creature sure must have considered it important... using his last strength to draw it...
tommy, i promised the babysitter six o'clock.
ben, i don't think he wants us here.
weren't you afraid?
i don't know.
okay, but it's not a date.  it's a dinner.
we don't have her i.d. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the king edward hotel.
i hate ignorance and stupidity.
this is this, vince. this isn't something else. this is this!
perhaps...
yes.
thank you...
it's not a 'sit down.' he said he's telling us the plan.
well, it's like i said, there's a ton of empty buildings around here and most of them were apparently given back to the city, so they're not private.... now, jahn here is an drama student at the university. he knows of a building that they were going to turn into a puppet theatre - they even began work on it, until they ran out of money.
not here tonight. wasn't here last night. he's especially not back in his office.
looks like somebody took a dump in it, that's the worst color job i've --
yes, sir.
we were just chortling over that. blasé and epicene.  it perfectly describes the new foreign secretary. so--i hope you don't mind, edward, i pinched it for my piece today.
you heard me.  you. congress and cabinet heads.
do you want to tell me what you found?
you're great with the advice, clark. maybe you'd better take over the lovelorn column.
i guess.
why do people think yellow is gender- neutral? i don't know one man with a yellow bedroom.
no. of course not, nothing like that.
those fuckin' niggers. this time i'm going to eat balls!... you ever try 'em?
yes you are. you always do. it's why we broke up. you always hide behind him.
i'm good at that.
i love lila. i mean, she's a wonderful person. and... she loves me! that's no small potatoes. i mean she really loves me. she's sacrificed so much to be in this relationship with me. and she's a good person. a truly good person. how rare is that in this world, eh? and how could i stop loving somebody because of a little physical imperfection, if it can even be called that. i mean, god knows i'm not perfect! what about my eyesight? it's lousy, that's what! lila's not going to leave me because of my eyesight. what about my penis?
why?
it's not about a nice girl who meets a sensitive boy. now granted that's what "true blue" is about, no argument about that.
"true love." he said, "true love," max. my god --
nothing, wade, i've been thinking. you don't get enough appreciation around here and it's time we changed things a little.
no.  mace is in this.
i'm not good company. i should be alone.
kathy, i'm about to tell you something i've never told any girl on a first date.  but i think it's important that you know.  i like to wear women's clothes.
i had to sleep with the lights on for a month.  but i never missed a lugosi picture after that.
he knows. he knows!
always, my dear one, never any further.  love is a child to be pacified with trifles.  a full diet can only kill it.
she's got a hidden pitbull. maybe she hired someone to kill them.
you do not know all that has happened.  you cannot understand.
great!  bring her, too.  but you better hurry.  i made nachos with non-fat cheese and they're almost gone.  i'll make some more though.
it's all right. she had a little too much to drink, that's all. forget it.  go upstairs and sleep it off.
nick. hey. how's things?
if i had you where i really wanted you, they'd be pumping your ass full of formaldehyde.
nonsense, jeff.
i will...
what is it, harry?
i think. anyway, i've tried all their colors. more than once. i'm getting too old for this. but it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. i apply my personality in a paste. you?
of course i do?  bring them up!
i'm hungry, mom....
for your own amusement?
what else?
yes.
well, what did you want?
i've got a hunch you're going to win that bet, inspector.
just give me a moment to get your keys.
did you shoot their boots?
horses - and sheep...
...tell graham --
we did find these, however.
get bruce out of jail! how can you worry about a man who's resting comfortably in a quiet police station while this is going on? hildy, this is war! you can't desert now!
uh huh.
i'll have me some of that punch there, too.
uh, is your mother ... still alive?
now darlin', what has the south got to do with this?
we've outlined a settlement...
sounds like he wanted to get caught.
oz.
me first! me first!
anyway, major, why should he leave his country, his mother tongue, his family, his history, his past, his future, just because now, suddenly, there is a dictatorship? why?
sal, i want my money.
no, i'm saying to be --
i'm out! i'm out!
isn't it? isn't it! you know i was a professor for twenty years? - and a very good one.
then you saw him, too?
injections.  even this noble sport's been fixed.  seen the guys?
i like plaits.
no offense.
i always thought jails make people hard. not you. you're just not tough enough to forget about beynon. i chose you, not him.
yeah it's horseshit, just some boogieman crap that the kids like to scare each other with.
and i only deal with you?
i'm in.
i don't know. you tell me?
ciao.
show me an american who can keep his mouth shut and—i'll eat him.
i made them, man....
well, one was for salad...
i know ...
sheriff?
yeah.  i could show it to you if you want to come over and see it.
doesn't matter. game's over.
i'm thirsty.
rawlston is my boss.
i don't know where he is.
you can't tell.
what are you doing?
so i guess you could say that we screwed up, but we weren't wrong.
thanks.  for everything.
it was his faith and devotion that are responsible for this organization.
george, i don't --
i just said let's have a little lunch.  room service.
let me by.
now i'll tell you something.  it wouldn't fucking matter if i offered you one hundred million dollars. you'd still be thinking the same thing, that you're going to take me. and here i am, sitting through this, knowing it's bullshit, looking at you and the only thing going on in my mind, the only thing i can think is that, in just a few minutes i'm going to take you.
i would but i am really running late and the 134's a parking lot after 2:00.  but listen, the guy gives you any more trouble, just give a call...
do you know it?
he was a degenerated warlock who could turn urine into beer, and the honor that he extended me gave me rights of occupancy in this sacred cave on this far-away siwash ridge. i came to the dakota hills to construct a clockworks of my own.
hey boss, it's not a science.
high mag, mr. sulu!
john.
yes.  i mean, i think so.  yes.  yes...
easy, virge, they're just tryin' to egg us on.
well, i give to the united way, and i feel that sort of covers --
too late for apologies, walker.
thanks for getting me back in one piece.
zat is true, i am not used to working in such 'orreeble conditions.  hey... monet!
probably from the nuclear warhead. cochrane was planning to use it to ignite the warp drive.
ethan, if you knew about jim?..why..
yes, crazy about you! kiss me, mr. hillyer!
you want me to show up late a few nights?
for chrissake give me a hand!
you have to warn her - this second! i'm catching the next flight back!
nicholas...
you'll be leaving then.  just as well. you never were cut out for this, henry. goodbye.
i felt that you could do better for yourself--
by color.
no! no! no!
karl, come over here. i want you to meet your new boss.  this is bill cox, runs this place. says you can work here and stay in the back.
because i'm a nurse.
get him in.
yeah well... i like movies. i figure if i help harry make one, i'll find out what you have to do outside of have an idea and raise the money. that doesn't sound too hard. i was in the money business and i get ideas all the time.
i thought i put you to bed.
yes, she is.
no thanks karl.
dirty pig!
hi, how are ya?  <u>listen</u> to this, willya...
i'd love to hear it.
ahh, rodin. mmm! he's the fuc-  i mean, he's the best. you must go to the rodin sculpture garden, in the huitieme, it's so beautiful.
i don't think anybody should change their names, that way you can always find them when you need them.
any irregularity in the pattern.
well, we all got to go sometime.
c-c-c-c-candy!
that's very convenient. i think i'd like that.
then go home, baby.
but i get a red light.
oh.
and you'd be my cousin?
am i home?
a massive cardiac arrest.
next.
you're fucking polish catholic--
if it isn't here, why would he wear that stupid key?
i don't know, but somebody did.
there aren't any more!  that's the whole barrel.
why didn't you tell me?
tell me you don't hate me louis. i did it for you -
do you think i have not considered that?  i have a plan -- and you may rest assured that it is brilliant!
yeah, well those things are gonna be on our ass every foot of the way, right?
i guess you are three-fingered jack out of missouri, killer of women and children.
sam!!! 
fine.
i hate to disappoint you -- i mean, many happy returns -- but not tonight --
that's not what i mean.  i'm going back over there tomorrow and talk to him.  i am.
wah...?  where are...?
jim...
and again and again! two hours late for the audition, to begin with-
deanna, i'm going to belt you right in the mouth!
i'm your daddy now, kirsty.
have now.
i remember the first time you walked into mrs. temple's class in 2nd grade. blue gingham dress. blond ponytail.
did you, um, did you get that pilot?
keep looking.
aye, it is but as long as you get by, it's all right, you know ... bash on, happy valley's when they let you stop. anyroad, i'd better get back.
not when sense/net throws the going away party. they'll be on our asses from now on.
jesus, ann, get a life. i just asked what he looked like.
fine. friends it is. i can live with that.
no, you talkin' at me.
ruiz knows about this?
i'm a welder.
aren't you on suspension?
i'm wearing contacts... also i read through <u>handbook for the</u> <u>recently deceased</u>.  it says that live people ignore the strange and unusual... not me... <u>i am</u> strange and unusual.
two hours a day, six days a week.
i don't sell this house, i tell you that. this is my husband's house. i had six children in this house.
uh-uh.  only if you got <u>above</u> a c on science.
yes. did you eat?
i know everybody. i don't look at half of life, just the nice half, i look at all of it.
erect in sweater, arms folded.
maybe we can get some of the local kids to sing with us.
i am now.  get me out of here.  just get me out of here.
you would, huh?
that's where my boat's moored.
yes.
the add just said &quot;makeup artist&quot;
you're not like my other teachers, professor tripp.
hell, yes, they know each other. he bonded her out of county.
it's documented. most serial killers are attractive--slightly off white males in their twenties.
-- there is a serious question as to whether --
you know it and i know it.
cute.
the men who came to see you at leavenworth. the one's who made the arrangement... who were they? maybe i can talk to them.
cameron?
california. oakland.
and last, but not least, adolph... you know who.
where the fuck do you think you're going?
yes. what was the orchestra's reaction when they asked you to play for hitler's birthday?
i'd like to see his house but...i don't know if i'd have the nerve to just go up and knock on his door. i don't think i can go through with it.
i just don't have anything very interesting about my life.
mckendrick's men got him.
and the rule was...
i want him here.  sit down!
that's the way these people are. you don't hit both pumps you just piss them off.
stand by the door.
american literature. what else?
with this chick.
it's dinner time. it really is. cross my heart.
goddamit, give me my tape, then.
i know, i know, a warrior. you're very annoying..now tell me how to defuse the bomb you've set..
...not the lazyboy...
you're so nice. 
if you're patching up bullet holes right here on the runway, maybe we should skip the housekeeping and get right to the planes.
oh, please, dad—
your mother wants to hear from you --
did we?
ha! and what do you have to do for him?
yeah, but some of the things they say your brothers've done...
huh.  i did not know that.  well, it's water under the bridge.  and we do enter the next round-robin, am i wrong?
you will know.  when you are at peace ... calm ... passive.  a jedi uses the force for knowledge and defense.  never for attack.
maybe i already have.
how nicely you've fixed the table, ninotchka.
species, keystones affect the entire ecosystem, that could explain all these worms, the water. you've got a crocodile.  bury your friend.
i didn't do that.
you mean my problem?
um... he was older.
<u>we</u>?
has anyone died?
who am i?? who are you, you schmucks, you can't even make a decent swastika.... give me the paint.  give it to me.
i missed you.
it happens to be a matter of life and death.
my kids were on that beach...
there isn't any us.
hot pants, please. i'm gonna be flying by in about five minutes with smokey on my tail. can you lock it off behind me?
but personal services are not the kind of thing i usually get into.
if i had one, evelyn, i think you know who'd be first and last --
hey karl, you off work?
are you sure it's all right for us to be here?
where you going?
lloyd, give it up.
you devil, it's mace, huh?  what've you got here, a billy?  use it on poor unfortunate offenders.
steady as you go...
figure you would have tried it already.
why would he do that? how would he know i was going to suddenly slip.
where's he?
why do mice go where there's cheese?[3]
but you're going to tell us anyway...
llewelyn can take care of hisself.
have we met?  there's something i can't quite --
what kind of lead?
yeah, baby, how's it going?
jim garrison?
the younger men have no respect. things are changing; i don't know what will happen.  michael, because of the wedding, people now know your name.
records are those big round black things, right?
that's a long fall.
what?
forget it.  the boys on the board want that shuttle to go on schedule.
you're not, as you americans say, dragging my leg, are you?
you'll be a lot sorrier before we're through with you.
yeah. sure.
sorry. i thought i was doing quite well.
we are animals after all.
of course... we'll just zap him up with the digital conveyor!
people are pretty cagey.  who do you know?
oh, i don't know. no, we'll go anywhere you want.
they will understand, sir.  to be undone by a third-rate burglary is a fate of biblical proportions.  history will treat you far more kindly than your contemporaries.
no. i was in the shower.
what would you say if you found your safe had been robbed?
yeah, something like that, but as i say, they didn't have time to tell me very much.
okay, this test is going to be about the theorems i told you about last week. you remember the...
she looks after other people's children.
let us not discuss this further. i am very pleased....
nick.
so? do what everyone does. try like hell for renewal.
not as weak as i.
you gonna share your half with him?
so you never knew your mother?
sounds fine. only that isn't how it's going to be.
no.
she loved the bull ring and the matador.  she danced to their destruction. now she dances to her own destruction.  her dance is of skulls.
i never lie.  ask max.  max, have i lied yet?
mr. shaw, this is an italian newspaper article saying you were a member of the board of centro mondo commerciale in italy, that this company was a creature of the cia for the transfer of funds in italy for illegal political-espionage activities.  it says that this company was expelled from italy for those activities.
if we are clean gollie will take us over at nogales. if we are hot we'll have to try laughlin at el paso.
you told him that?
i don't believe this. it's a miracle, michael. a miracle.
condensed milk - one of the truly great inventions.
how does a terrorist like renard supply his men with state-of-the-art russian army weapons?
thanks...
yes.
"angel!"  i didn't say "angel," that's a little strong.  listen, here's the thing, i gotta get over there to the tv station to collect my million bucks.
listen to her? <u>her</u>? when she was willing to sacrifice us all?
and you say that came from lisca bianca?
all these parties are so marvellously <u>alike</u>.
oh, is that so?
you're the one talking to a little guy in your head.  ...we'll have to do it on our own.
expect it.  did you get anything from the room?
i'll make it.
dr. thompson, just so the jury knows, you never treated deborah ann kaye.  is that correct?
stay quiet...stay quiet, son --
what are you going to do, v?  shoot me?  kill me in cold blood?  i don't think so.  i'll tell you why.  if you had it in you to pull that trigger, you would have done it a long time ago.  if i was you, i would have killed me the minute i brought the money home.  but you didn't and i know why, because you don't want to kill me.  do you, v?  do you? no, i know you don't.
how do you know there's two ounces in a drink?
how long were you gonna let me try and stop it...?
kevin's gone, your daddy's gone, everybody's gone.
then don't do it.
ice crystals everywhere. this place is a deep freeze.
you're making a joke.
i made this place..... now listen to me. i'll get out of this room, we have bigger troubles than this....
te, kawnarna paraikete mo te tahi hawlie 0 te whenna uci.  unsubtitled
rio, baby!
i got nowhere to go.  we haven't had a good sit-down for a long while.
if you want to go on, i can make it all right.
fuck you! 
all right... i want you... to... kill... sailor... as simple as that.
nothing.
especially with an election coming up in a few days.
i know. but i've converted most of them into ridiculous "guy" rooms -- a billiard room, a card room, a gym -- honey, want you to go out, as soon as you feel up to it -- and buy married things. woman things. personalize it. marylinize it. make this your house.
but don't you have to work?
no, no thanks. hey, don't-
or her figger.
don't know her.
yeah.
you're kidding.
no, you're very good at it. i'm really impressed.
...but the president wonders about the possible albanian backlash...
[the ransom money. at the drop. he said tazinari, one of the policemen had taken it. he was crazy.]
i don't want to move away.
i find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs.
blonde went crazy. he slashed the cop's face, cut off his ear and was gonna burn him alive.
my work may take me out of new york.
nah.
where's dylan?!  have you seen him?
that was so great!
yes.
that's a big if.
i knew it!... i knew it!...
yep.
it's very nice, but it's still a little pricey for us.
thought you were another wife, maybe.
next time you pull any shit, i'm gonna kick your fat ass.
look - sam, i've been independent my whole life. i never had to ask anybody for anything. now you're making me beg you for this.
can't break tradition. it's bad luck.
you're crazy. those girls love me.
send that.
i hate the thought of guys hitting on you all the time.
no little girl can ever make me come.
we'll get you whatever you want.  get that other kid. we might need him.
her majesty's routine at osborne house is not as you will remember it.  the household remains in full mourning and no-one is permitted to raise their voice under any circumstances whatsoever.  as for the queen's routine, she breakfasts at nine thirty, lunches at two,takes tea at five thirty and dinner at eight forty five.  no one is allowed to leave the building while the queen is at home. on the rare occasions when she is out, you may ask permission to leave, but only with my consent. you're to be ready to walk the pony at any time after ten o'clock.  you'll clean her outdoor things and do any odd jobs as and when she requires.
sounds quite beautiful.
that thing is twenty hours from earth. we know nothing about it yet.
check.
i went back there, and dante was already waiting for me.
you bust some small-time pimps, whores and dime-bag junkies, like the world's a better place because you're in it.  and for what, kittle... two hundred and fifty dollars a week? tell me, how does anyone get so self-rightious when they can barely afford to pay their rent?
mark!
not for long.
there are things you know for sure.
we keep going, that's what we do.  we ignore them, maybe they ignore us.
alright. come on, you guys.

please -- was at the time brandishing your firearm, trying in his rage to shoot an acquaintance -- friend of long standing --
not that.  i mean the re-channeling of my sexual energy.  maybe we shouldn't make love for awhile.
well, if you didn't like it, you didn't like it, but you didn't have to talk while the guy was singing.
d'you ask the patient when did she last eat?
great!
she's doing just fine.
course i'll say grace if somebody sets out the food--  --but my heart ain't in it.  nice drinkin' liquor.
and you think it's worth all this?
details, baby, details.
i got the ring. <i></i> tonight's the night, herb. tonight's the night.

how do you know?
yes, daddy.
ah... northeast... sir.

i'm sorry, i was at the theater and i didn't receive your note until i returned to my hotel.
and oswald?
thanks.
they've gotten worse since i took away her credit cards.
you're gonna hafta learn to deal with it.
can't you see, she's trying to kill us.
reading the patient's vital signs.
i don't know who.
gentlemen, i have a plan. it's called blackmail. the royal family of britain are the wealthiest landowners in the world. either the royal family pays us an exorbitant amount of money, or we make it look like prince charles, the heir to the throne, has had an affair outside of marriage and, therefore, they would have to divorce.
it's not the english way, for ladies to have two lovers, and, so, mr. dugan, i'll thank you to pay me the sum you owe me, and i resign all claims to this young lady.  if she has a fancy for school-boys, let her take 'em, sir.
walter just got it back from the framer today.
what?
yeah, i know.
a lot of things.  all i know is i'll be back in six months.
you're telling me that, i should take my daughter to a witch doctor? is that it?
you watch the draft this year? 'course you didn't, idiot question. they try to make it dramatic, like there's some big surprise who picks who in the first round? only they been working it over with their experts and their computers for months. doctor's reports, highlight reels, coaches' evaluations, psychological profiles--hell, i wouldn't be surprised if they collected stool samples on these boys, have 'em analyzed. all this stuff to pick a football player for your squad. compared to that, what you know about the person you get married to don't amount to diddly, does it?
we're looking into it bob, but they really want you to stay to do that talk show friday, apparently it's a really big deal, he's the johnny carson of japan.
this rae... you get with her?
umhummmmph.
you know you can.
charges!  come on, come on!
yeah, that's me.  just a little somethin' somethin' i picked up.

bah, you're a child, lerner. rhah don't waste time on you.
i have a headache.
yeah, and i'm putting my money where my ugly mouth is. i'm putting you back in the numbers right now.  baby, what's today?
only if you'll tell me who he is.
butt-ugly owl.
but do you stand for anything?
my name is no longer carjack. will you please get that through your fucking head?
one i think you will like... as a, how shall i put it, as a symbol of our new understanding. an understanding between two friends.
roof? jesus, skinny, i done practically every damn thing myself. roberts boy hauled wood, that's all.
i'm on my way with eddie.  ludwig's. 63rd and madison.  the suspects might be there already.
i have a son of my own. about you boy's age. i can imagine how painful this must be for you. but clarence and that bitch-whore girlfriend of his brought this all on themselves. and i implore you not to go down the road with 'em. you can always take comfort in the fact that you never had a choice.
nonsense, my friend. i can look on anything i like. and i am particularly fond of looking on crucifixes.
i'm not going!
don't go.
yeah, you told me that later.
forty-fourth floor, and it's very --
how could i be?  we learned some magic...
there's no one in there. stay out of my motherfuckin bedroom.
i'll see you later. all right?
i thought you were asleep.
that's the only way we'll get the place fixed up in time.
`they lied.'  indeed!  when did they lie?  and do you know what a lie is?
hello.
mornay has come. so will the bruce.
bird. that's jazz.
either fight the way things are or accept it.
he hasn't done bundy.  he's done every one of the others, hasn't he? if there are three dead chi omega college girls tomorrow, how will you feel?  go there.  see if there could be any way for him to escape.
are you gonna open the safe?
where ya goin', mac?
it isn't a question of knowing what to do, it's knowing how to get in one that counts.
agent mulder.
knock it off, burt!
you walked out on a job for me, and i won't ruin that.
and now we're glad you did.
we won't breathe a word.
okay.
that's impressive. how did you do that?
he was delightful.
with us old creeps?  come on, we have to eat.
call me later, hon.
it's not too late!
everything.  start at the beginning.
isn't there an easier way?
a good deal of it, i reckon. can't understand all of it.
truck.  of course.
no. i might be interested in that, uh, business proposition--
could i get a <u>drink</u>,  n'i don't <u>care</u>, you see, what all they got me doin, for i'd rather be doin' <u>makework</u>, than be doin' <u>pub'l'relations</u> with the dirty dozen, one <u>hispanic</u>, one <u>librarian</u>, one <u>jew</u>, and one from column a, and one from column...  thank you.
you sure can, son...
yeah.
stop calling her a kid! it so happens there are particular aspects of my life to which i would like to maintain sole and exclusive rights and privileges!
and what do you possibly think you're going to fucking see there?
i'm twenty-five years old, ma'am.
thank you.
but how?
oh, that's taken care of. i called the state attorney's office. you were no-filed this morning in circuit court.
moving along -  a typical plastic security card. name here, magnetic information stripe here -  and a code breaking microprocessor here. swipe it through any card reader - anywhere - you're in.
what are those mirrors for?
it's obvious, isn't it?
i've lost you.  you're gone.  i can't hear anything.
you still think it'll be easy shootin' them cowboys?
faith--
two more charges to go.
always in a rush.
what?
yes, just the two.
i hope you're ready for this.
look -- those are the first metals that came through. 
no.
no.  this is fine.  just take a bite, you'll like it fine.
the rosatos are running crazy; taking hostages, spitting in my face, because they're backed by the jew in miami.
have you been in?
are you a believer, then?
jesus.
sir, i can explain.
for this...you don't need to be.
the president and i were delighted that we could accommodate you.  now if you're all cleared?  you can follow me then.
i'm tough, creasy. i'm tough as you.
came here to fire you, jerry.
anyone got another set of sails?
sorry. never heard of her.
she goes on location tomorrow.  sally, i'm sorry.  look, i can't keep her on hold.
where are you staying while you're here?
this is a bad day for me.
out the door and to the left.
yeah, sure. we were losing the war.
put them all together and what do we have?
i won't.  and when i tell drew about it, he won't either.
what can you do when you have to be a man?
i just feel like i'm always starting over. you said how many bonds you wrote?
suspect zero, now there's an idea that doesn't look good on paper --
call him -- i mean it can wait, right?
bad sportsmanship. a ruthless minority of people seems to have forgotten certain good old fashioned virtues. they just can't stand seeing the other fellow win. if these people would just play the game, instead of standing on the touch line heckling -
it seems that you and i have some talking to do.
the park dude was missing an arm.
ok.  if you want this room, you can have it.
i was lucky to find, much less crack, the address code -- no way to be sure i could have done it again.
well, i just don't know how to thank you, mr. barnes --
what are you talking about? there's no fat on this body.
what you have to understand, francie, is that she... well... she wanted so much for herself too, and for me, and she never really got to... the only time i ever saw her happy was if her name was in the papers... but she could have been... if times were different she could have been a politician or... i don't know.
boys, that was some mighty fine pickin' and singin'. you just sign these papers and i'll give you ten dollars apiece.
i'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home.
i know.
... oh, really...
i'm gonna open the shop, baby, i'm gonna open the shop. i'm getting it together.
merry, how... oh, christ, of course, you had my phone tapped.
what's the matter? i've got something that's chokin' me. i've gotta get it out.
certainly.
he's a friend. from the neighborhood. we were just talking.
no, it doesn't.  now, remember: you never delivered this.  you got caught in the traffic, or something.  now, get out of here and don't let anybody see you.
agreed. options?
oh, i'm just typing up a funeral notice, you know when someone dies people want it in the paper usually, it's a service we provide for the family.
how are you, jane?
leave it, ann.
i don't know.
ah, captain?
oh, god.
can't you get him?
we'll make it.
what the hell good is hooker to ya?
where's applejack?
saddle river's in new jersey.
so you admit it?
aqui! [here!]
is that all you say?
not really.  i've just always been fascinated by mars.
and your husband works for somebody else.
of course.
yes!  this is about me.  why can't you understand that, you of all people? it's not the war -- it's nixon!  they want to destroy nixon!  and if i expose myself even the slightest bit they'll tear my insides out.  do you want that?  do you want to see that, buddy?  it's not pretty.
more questions. always the explorer. if you stay long enough, that'll change.
shelby --
six years.
-- you got your sink --
good heart, at what?
kay!?
he's in the living room asleep.
two nights.
don't worry.  you won't even see her.
uh-huh.
no.  hi baby.
look, i'm not saying you don't have a daughter. it's just that she's not my daughter.
i thought you did.
yes, there was a man with you... she brought you here... she didn't know what else to do.
don't get sentimental now dad -- save it 'til we get out of here.
i don't know the details of the treaty, sire, marshal mortier sent me word of its having been agreed to, and he said that i was to take the army and make for fontainebleau.
well that depends.
what do you mean?
i look around, i see a lot of dry eyes. the director was not...  ...universally loved.  he was leading the cut-backs in the program.  you're looking at a room full of motives.
no, you gotta go to mcgrud-...
well, technically i did what ya said.
it is the gathering, my friend.  the settling of old scores.
you mean afghanistan?  it won't require my attention.  what i'm doing here is far more interesting.
aloha means hello and goodbye.
i don't know.
tut, tut!  i can play at fencing as well as you, mr. roderick james. ah!  you change color, do you?  your secret is known, is it?  you come like a viper into the bosom of innocent families; you represent yourself as the heir to my friends the o'higgins of castle o'higgins; i introduce you to the nobility and gentry of this methropolis; i take you to my tradesmen, who give you credit.  i accept your note for near two hundred pounds, and what do i find?  a fraud.
there's a poison in the upper classes, bob.  they've had it too soft.  too many cars, too many color tvs ...
jesus christ, i'm getting a boner just looking at it.
you'll be rich!
i don't remember seeing any ponds up there.
what the fuck? i just asked you for a job yesterday!
no: you're on fire!
won't take two.
so is that what all this is? someone have a problem with us living here?
i thought i was.  i was confused.
guy's the toxic avenger.
you were reading my renoir.
[you're a liar. pinta's dead.]
rashid? rashid! is that what he told you his name was?
can i tell you something?  can i tell you a secret?
no, i don't care about you -- you're fantastic.  my whole interest, if it's not too late, is in susie...and how to undo what you've done to her...
jesus christ. this is all i need.
jason  you think you could-get any closer to those mines?
we'd travel north, my bride and i. to the furthest reaches of the pole, where no man has ever set foot. there we would live out our lives. together.  no human eye would ever see us again. this i vow.
i don't know.
how badly do you want that money?! how bad do you want to stay out of jail?
good. now, if you'll pardon me, i have to go to work.
you'll be a father any minute now.
i got the gasoline --
no. i'm a marked man, jez. i'm the only one left. i don't want to expose you to that. it's not right for you or me. be reasonable.
drop it, jake.
she has never mentioned her family.
how's the water?
why aren't you at work?
up the organization!  bastard.
the matrix isn't real!
that's it! you're gone!
oh, knock it off! _ 89.
yeah -- that's me. the happy idiot -- a million laughs.
no.  her case is too advanced.  but maybe, someday, with more research-
in the meantime we must endeavor to piece together what happened here tonight. according to our data banks, this ship fired those torpedoes.
i did?
yes.  i tried to talk to ted-- my ex-husband--about it, but he wouldn't listen.  he refuses to discuss it in any serious way. i remember one time he said i probably couldn't get a job that would pay enough to hire a baby- sitter for billy.
you don't think god'll mind, do you?
good.  now take the forceps, and remember, vincent, what we're doing here is routine.  i've done stuff like this at least twenty times in the field.  there are no vital organs where you're working, no major muscles or arteries -- you can't kill me.  just make sure you've got the bullet before you try to pull it out.
yeah. just babies.
wait here.  if you have to use this, use it.  don't choke. okay?
it's magic.
mine, too.
did you get my note?
i don't know.  something wes had taught me.  i think it means "don't shoot. we're your friends."
wait, doctor -- wait!  the child's fainting.
this should take care of mother.
we've been over this a hundred times. it's too dangerous for him.
decay unfortunately doesn't limit itself to the denture, mr. baker. it spreads into his chest. then the heart goes. we wouldn't want that, would we?
can't wait.
of course, he's in the lineup. there he goes right there. hey, babe...!
no, thank you. my house has been closed.
starfleet, boost your matter gain; we need more signal!
poor child --  i wish i were free tonight -- we could --
every night, on the couch.
i know...  but dad, you can't go back.  you didn't die in that fire.  and no matter what you do, nothing is gonna change that.  so all we can do is deal with this...and try to make it right.
yes.
we're gonna use them for demonstration  footage.
if i owe, i will go.
goody!
tell those spineless toads we'll self-insure if they don't write it... you fire 33 vice presidents and nothing changes...  you eating twinkies today, bud, or are you schtupping some stewardess...
you'll be dead soon enough anyway, so why be in such a hurry?  why not face up to your lies?  it's your lies you can't stand anymore...
will you relax, please? they're gonna love you, i know.
no... don't hit me please...
she's evil.  she's brilliant.  be careful, nick.
it's out of our hands.  this is it.
the chop-shop... where are the stripped cars?  the rolled-back odometers? the part bins?
i don't know nothing about it.
i wasn't standing around guarding the local taco bell.  i've worked homicide for five and a half years.
so in your grief you wandered into a jaguar dealership?
scratch will do for the evening. may i -- join you?
are you sure? how's your knee?
but what has to be different?
i think that thing is ben.
how much tea do you drink, prime minister?
open the bolt!
not you. some assholes on the elevator... are these bitches on a permanent smoke break or what? why the fuck they call'm "working girls."
sorry, son. i can't do it. you signed the 1240/a. it would be illegal.
yes, something was...
a little homeopathic cure for the willies.
was she helpful?
poets have silly notions about plants and bodily secretions.
just a habit. mr. schuyler is a bit put out by all the rumors going around.
okay.  so i had this...thought, and...this may seem like it's out of left field, and i don't know if you can, but since i'm not going with anyone --
try cates.  and let's talk in private, okay?
three bullets! any good?
there's really no need.  this is just a scrapbook.  i should feel obliged.  thank you.
yeah.
yes.
comedy. i don't play tragedy.
porch. i'm puttin' a porch on her so's i can puff my pipe of an evening an' drink my coffee an' watch the sun set.
well, ah...i thought it over and i decided we're doing it murray's way.
mr. kovic.   we're not here about your taxes.
yes.
don't think it's not going to cost you.
yes! but "love" isn't the operative word here, peace is!
maybe twenty gallons an hour.
i need to tell you something, and i'm not sure how.
i'm going to anyway, because it may make a difference to you later on. you said you knew about ilsa and me.
no, he's absolutely right.  you're absolutely right, ryan.  dog talk must be banned.  canine conversations are completely discouraged... it's really good of you to join us.  can i get you a drink?
now we have eight hundred guests and one hundred staff. i have ten minutes left.
hello ... no. he's not here. i haven't seen him all night ... i don't know when ... what? tell him what?  vietnam? ... what experiments?
oh my gosh...
yes.
certainly.
starting with a screw?
if you buy what you read in the paper.
i know.
i think it is an interesting notion to keep mozart in vienna, majesty. it should really infuriate the archbishop beyond measure - if that is your majesty's intention.
... my god...
good. i want you out. this is my sewer.
excuse me.
peter criss is my inspiration, man. if i paid a hundred bucks for a kiss show and all i saw was his solo, i'd consider it... money... hey, how'd you know that?
yes well...  you are a credit card holder, are you not?
it's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us.
i'm here with you.
i touched a nerve.
but i just bought a good blanket.
yes. it is today.
okay.
yeah. scary stuff.
let 'em eat their hearts out.
where will you go? the circus is halfway to metropolis by now.
it's his dog.
let's get a second opinion.  wilson? what do you see?
i thought you got rid of...
set!
a raptor claw. i use to have one. a fossil.
you could have infected him, isn't that right?
of course. natural weather delivered to your door on demand. down your phoneline. for limited periods.
no.
sure... dissolve to ext hogan house -- night
i know. maybe that makes us tough. rich fellas come up an' they die, an' their kids ain't no good, an' they die out. but we keep a-comin'. we're the people that live. can't nobody wipe us out. can't nobody lick us. we'll go on forever, pa. we're the people. 
is there a rush?
the indian.  i was about 30 yards away.
i love you, you're a genius.
peters and i will search the forward decks. justin, take engineering. no hot-dogging, not on this one, alright?
but you just said that a month was too...
i couldn't say it any better than huxley.
oh, man, i've been trying to call you.
i asked you to marry me. i'm ready for marriage. that's responsibility. that's growth.
what else?
what's he like?
they were ...
what! get married?
i don't know. you- it's like you're- you're removed.
ron...ronny, you know you do have to go on in twenty-five minutes.
what if i was vince?  you'd be dead right now.  what are you doing giving interviews on tv?
lenny?  you're an asshole.
i am nina ivanovna yakushova, envoy extraordinary, acting under direct orders of comrade commissar razinin. present me to your colleagues.
and he killed every last one of 'em!
oh huh
it comes here from cable junction.
for god's sake, forget the money! i'm going crazy! i'm a walking anachronism. i'm a puddle of deja i'm worried about my kids, scott must be scared to death, i think my daughter's doing drugs again. i can't have any fun here, i don't have that innocence any more. i can't keep all this in anymore. i feel like i'm going to explode.
i got it and i used it. we found the entrance to the catacombs.
ibm.
our moms suck!
veidt's assassin.  leads to follow.  can't just --
then when is he going to engineering?
i'm sure that's true, miss. and that's why we're doin' what we're doin'. what's happenin' underground here is just what lucifer planned for this sinful race o' man. but we're gonna beat lucifer. we're gonna put an end to what's happenin' here.
yes -- 'hildy, darling'. i'm just a fool. that's what i am. i know what it's going to be like.
what do you mean?  i checked them myself.  i made the calls...
fine. well, that's all there is to it. are you alright?
dammit, i hate sounding so clinical all the time. all i meant to say was i thought you were doing well, but then i...
excuse me?
well, there are.  and we don't need to go anywhere near that far.  my best friend slipped -- she slipped down- stairs, cracked her back and she's in a wheelchair for the rest of her life. all i'm asking for is a normal amount of perspective.
i try not to.
we have a renew-your-subscription offer...
doctor jones?
oh, yeah. no. i mean yeah, i stopped by for a drink. didn't see you.
so what?!  so fucking what?  use your head, violet.  the money is gone.  gino is coming here to get it.  you think he's going to believe me if i tell him his piss-hole son stole it!  is that what you think? i don't.  you know what i think?  i think i'm a dead man.  i'm one in the brain.  that's what i think!
not yet. 
i'm not joking boy.  don't feed it. it'll only make it hungrier.
yeah... the one that introduced santos to you and clyde.
when you have a moment.
yeah...
that's very presumptuous.
i'm en route. e.t.a. in five.
wha-at?
it hasn't been laid out, we haven't finished with the embalming. as a matter of fact, you're looking at it. the remains of margo channing. sitting up. it is my last wish to be buried sitting up.
good. professor brown tested the tarp, noting in satisfaction that it was secure. i'll pick you up in front of the school at midnight. don't be late -- we're cutting it close as it is. we've got a long drive ahead of us.
you will spend that hour getting acquainted with george bailey.
let's sit down. they walk to the table. lois calls out to the balcony.
you're the getaway girl. the money's gonna get to you eventually. gonna be my job to be the guy who walks outta there with it. but i can't do that without a gun. any luck talking to him?
katrina's not my girlfriend! and i doubt she was actually giving you the stinkeye. she just looks like that all the time.
hello? jean, i need help!
firefly must be captured at any cost.
vegas! you think we'll get there by midnight?
yeah, but i ain't got time to spend the money i make here.
you saw this?
he's got my daddy's watch, claude. i always knew whoever took that watch killed winston hancock. and that was you, mr. pike.
overseas operator?  please dial allgemeine bank, zurich.

i am sorry...
of course.
he's too tall.
i did it!  i got the box open.
what time is it?
yeah. but i've got gorignak staring me in the face. i think i can take it though...
i reckon it's been ordained this way, brother spoon.
that was my plan.
no -- you're not.
not in houston. we'd be better off in some place more out of the way.
don't bother!
i understand. i'm just real curious like you said.
i will, old boy, tomorrow.  our work is done here.  just came to say goodbye, and good luck.
i don't think so.
we're on sublevel six.  we'll pass some labs and then we'll hit the stairwell--
see if you can guess.
you lie.
and i want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.
then why'd they bother to crack the safe?  you can drop a mosler 90 from mount baldy and it won't open.
party needs the bread.  be hip to the struggle, only a dollar!!!
order out like a philistine, when you got the galloping gourmet here?...
all right. all right --  john, just sit tight will you? i'll read your report, i'll discuss it with the others. i'll be back next thursday, we'll talk the whole thing over then. nothing til thursday, all right?
blimey.  what's that?
what?!
ned!
every class has its surprises, pyro. this one'll be no different.
so i have to have a motive to be with you?
he didn't waste it.
hey take it easy man. they're scared.
his file listed you as a known associate.  now spill.
not for long.
sure.
name it.
yes, sure.
at this point we don't have much.
did you tell sandy?
then let him. what have we got to lose, you and i?
i could give you a false name, but i won't.  just call me x.
supernumerary. it means better than expected.
i'm leaving tonight.  i'm going to need my clothes. and my gun.
ok.
you didn't hire me.  she did. if she wants me off the job, i want to hear it from her.
so they say.
i was just thinking about where i'm gonna stay.  i lost the house.  it's like waking up from a goddamn nightmare.
a few thousand scattered about the globe. in the past, we've had to restrict our numbers for fear of discovery. that won't be necessary after tonight.
just passing through.
you know? i remember coming here with my parents.
to warn him.
how you going to get there?  you can't trust the spooks to pull you out.  they'll use you up and throw you away.
i mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. i mean, no offense.
i'm not getting halo'd.
congratulations, enzo.
nicholas...
wow, this lab looks great.  except why is there a stove and refrigerator?
well -- how come?
i don't see why any man should get excited when he is asked about his hometown.
what?
it's not me, moron.
staring at us?
i never tried it.
that's precisely what <i>scares</i>me--that they won't do anything <i>foolish</i> or <i>courageous</i> or <i>anything</i>--worth a goddamn.
does alyssa know?
you always think you know what i'm going to say, don't you?  you always think you're two steps ahead of me. the lawyer.
i heard you the first time. we had nothing to go on with this kid. just a runaway.  do you really think he's in danger?

er ... pray tell me why?
i'm not fond of television comedies.
two. shaken not stirred.

i like to watch.
take me away...
oh my gosh. i hardly know what to say.
i'm freezing.
it must have been safe.
well, i'll tell you--we picked him up about a year ago-- but could never pin anything on him.
the orderly heard lecter whispering to him, all afternoon, and miggs crying. they found him at bed check. he'd swallowed his own tongue... chilton is scared stiff the family will file a civil rights lawsuit, and he's trying to blame it on you. i told the little prick your conduct was flawless.  starling...?

what?
we know.

it's called a spinal block, and you can't have it yet, honey. the doctor said you're not dilated enough.

there was this case.  a serial.  he murdered three women, all nurses, between '68 and '69.  the papers called them the nightingale murders.  they never caught him.  but the killings just stopped.

just several days ago, the thought of anna being dead would have made me sick. and now, i don't even cry, i'm afraid she might be alive. everything is becoming so damned simple and easy, even to deprive one's self of pain and suffering.
sally--!
it's impossible to know exactly when or how i was infected with hiv.
a man, young lady! lady, such a man as all the world- -why, he's a man of wax.

u.s. wildlife won't send anybody without a confirmation.
hey, mister joker, have a heart, bro. it's friday.
okay...
leland...
i'll help pay for nicole, if that's what you're really talking about. i'll even give you the money i got for my kids.  that's what we used to do, remember? help each other.  this was a community.
a rest?

as you wish.
there are no objections to my staying here with her, are there?
yes, yes, i remember you.
i had suggested that they tone down the program so that the "guests" might take longer to expire.
but there must be a reason. this is science, not art.
well, you did invite me here.
that's not it.
i thought 4th brigade cleaned out p.
marla?
a boy?
no, this one's for real, peter.  spengler went down there and took some pke readings. right off the top of the scale.  buried the needle.  we're close this time. i can feel it.
yeah.
i'd like to, thanks.
then i won't bring you....

our computer went on the fritz again. david came up to fix it.
i'm grateful, frank.  how much? for the singer.
boy, this town. word gets around, doesn't it?

son.  good to seeya.  good to seeya.
monsieur le marquis, i am a soldier, not a diplomat. you called this parlay for a reason.
after your mother died, he was sad all the time, but before that, he was pretty funny.
it happened so fast no one knew what hit them 'til is was over.
are you kidding me? what's to like?
what is it? what's the matter? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           56.
...across the border. come on!
you two are worse than a couple of schoolboys.
what makes you think it's you?
sometimes right when you're looking at them.
when this is over you can say whatever the hell you want. i'll be long gone. besides, who's going to believe you? you're just a two-bit crook.
haiti and puerto rico.  money through dubai and geneva maybe.
you want me to kill 'em.
all set, ann?
why do you even like me?
i'll catch up with you.  you can go with the others.
you mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?
yeah, i got that. some people think it's all in their heads.  it's been so bad she's had to move back here to mumford and live with us. and i'm not sure that's the best thing, either...
--i don't trust anybody, not even me, anymore--
i'll tell her.
this one's got you working overtime, hasn't it?
don't touch anything.
sure.
uh...  my friend over here would like a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale.
i buy them flowers.

what's the use of fighting, hildy?
fine, bob. how are you?
i'm working on that soccer story.

it's been months. it's not like him.
nag, nag, nag, nag. nag.
i remember a bat. a monster. a demon. chasing me.  oh my god, alfred.
french?
two cents.
would it make you anymore amusing?
blackburn's dead.
"there are times... i wish i hadn't done it. but there are times that i feel compelled to do it..." "i've -- if you asked me if i would do it again or if it's -- do i think it's worth it. yeah. i think it's worth it."
i follow the wires.
getting cold.
don't be long, ellen.
brought on by what?
so?  so?
you're shelly?
well, i don't think we have a whole lot to say to each other, ben. i do think you should know the consequences of what you've done. i do think you should know that my wife and i are getting a divorce soon.
the boxes. in the house. i told you.
you wanna keep up the conversation, you best come back with the proper permits and the right attitude.
no, you got quite a mess here, i'll admit that.  maybe you oughta put some screening on top of your chimney  seems a little pointless, though. freak accident like this wouldn't happen again in a million years.  you want some help cleaning up?
now, i have two rubbers.  wear them both, it'll desensitize you.  i don't want you coming so damn early.
i think i met her.  now tell us something we don't know, like where they stashed her.
it's been six years.
i don't never see nobody anyhow.
no, sir, no response.
i wouldn't touch that if i were you.
i saw him.
yeah...  ...huh, what the hell are you talking about?
thought you hated sidnaw.
it's a novel.
are you all right, dorothy?
wait.  did i just say "hon" to him?
yes, i do. there's ruth barnes.
time to do what?
she did, huh.
you've just said you signed it.
he didn't look good at all. something strange is going on. he's got himself into some trouble. he wouldn't say what.
calling an individual, charles, in new york. confirming a social outing for friday night.
umm, i don't think that...
never heard of him.
so what was the first day after heather's suicide like?
you took her because she helped me.
yeah, no, it wasn't even my idea.
i suppose i might blame her for opening her house to the men most responsible to my downfall, but how can i?  she was on her own again, she had to look after her own affairs, and how can one blame her for having her head turned by the attention of kings?
what if they're carrying? did you even check?
you're saying "me."
all right.  let's clear the mess and move out.
er, guys. where's the hockey player?
"age of enlightenment". shit. like some waitress in a las vegas coffee shop is going to get an obscure french philosophical reference. how demeaning. i may as well have just said "let me jump your ignorant bones."...
one's enough.
the government knows. i cannot repeat it to you. but this thing goes deep, ed. this was not your wife. i goes deep, and involves the government. there is a great deal of fear. you know how certain circles would find it--the knowledge--a threat. they try to limit it, and--
ahh hahahhnnn hahnnn!
that's all past, lestat.
this is where you live?
gee, i better not, if it's okay. i still gotta drive back up to los ang-gleez.
bacon, the fat man and myself, and it's time to make a call to harry.
i'm okay, matt.

they seem to like the idea.
hi.
let's get a cab.
what's so special about him?
... absolutely not.
oh, thank heaven.
i'm not in the mood for native american wisdom.
they all say the cat killed this second girl.
shouldnt've done that.
near carvel?
thanks. hope you do too.
okay, then i'll tell you something funny. you know who i mean by dr. raszeja.
no. i'm serious about this.
yes. can i - could i help you, in any way?
deodorant.
son.  little excitement out at the reservation this morning. wayne and dale elkhart were up drinking all night and then wayne starts chasing dale around the desert with his shotgun. bia handled it. i went by for backup.
you should be ashamed of yourself.
no shit! that why they call him ice?
i don't think he'll smell anything - just make sure he takes the check. i've been through this a hundred times.
what...?  oh.
you are not gonna believe this, evelyn!  absolutely fantastic!  i'm on my way --
perfect.  god, i'm so relaxed around you.
you gotta keep clear, tom. the fambly's breakin' up. you *got* to keep clear.

i know, look at his little hands.
i'm sorry i ruined everything. if i wasn't here you could go out.
what do you know about the ear?. anything?
how’d you do this year, tony?
what are you here for?
but you know who she was.
i went up to the magic castle. you were right.  he didn't have a lot of fans up there.
we have that taken care of.  you only heard three shots and you are not to talk to anyone about this. no one, you hear?
or maybe you just think you do. just another small town. one guy chasing you. you go big town. just gonna have four guys after you instead. kiss kissy kiss. it gets down to one thing -- are you a human being or are you one of those hungry ghosts out there never satisfied with nothing? cause you gotta remember you can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, that's where you gonna be.
would you like to sit down, joe?
i want to be normal!
and what if something happens to you? am i suppose to go in after you alone?!
well... i've been on blind dates before... matter of fact, to be honest, i've been picked up before.  okay.
mitchell was too drunk.
it's ichiro.  ich.
hey it's me, what are you doing?
is it inside the city?
maybe i don't want to meet someone who shares my interests.  i hate my interests! where can i go to meet the exact opposite of myself?
the building has been occupied and the locks have been changed.
maybe i should get out of the game. what do you think, buddy?  go back to being a lawyer and end up with something solid, some money at the end of the line ... you know, i keep thinking of my old man tonight.  he was a failure, too.
senator rowley's widow, sophie, is hosting an evening reception tomorrow evening honoring ambassador skrapinov of the soviet union... i think it's rather obvious that robert won't allow me to attend, so - would you go in my place, and escort eve?
certainly, outside. all the best homes have 'em outside.
i don't want to go --
came all the way down here to jump in and swim with the kiddies, huh?
close your mouth!  keep silent.
not without jamie.
i didn't hurt you.
what time of year?
not bad fresh, but they don't keep worth a pig's fart.
sure. ciao.
are you sure you...?
it's right behind you.
yes, madame.
go where?  where're you going?
that's my plan.
uh... you... you can pick out up to ten movies...
now, now, emma, dear--you mustn't forget we have been chosen by the people of this commonwealth to--
the hell is that?  what kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?
uh uh. somebody felt much worse. and i'm starting to understand why.
jesus christ, the man doesn't want to talk, so get off his back an' let's get on to some new business.
i don't understand --
sure, heaven! you've probably thought up another coal mine to send me down in -- to get a new story for your paper!
shakespeare was french! the queen mother sucks cocks in hell! shit! fuck! piss!
so have i
sidney, i know you by now.  don't do a dance with me...
tonight we open new doors.
but he asks the impossible. i need more men.
no, thanks.  love a little bundt cake if you have some!
but --
what a jerk -- and like nobody knows who he really is!
i found this old address book in a jacket i ain't worn in a coon's age. toby what? what the fuck was her last name?
by the way, jack, this looks like a pretty straight-forward transaction to me, but we should get into it soon -- just take a few minutes, maybe up at the house ...
oh, thank you, sir!
i told you! i've got everything!
the first rule of fight club is -- you don't talk about fight club.
no, sir.
oui.
a synthetic opium analogue.
do you miss it?
you walked?
no, i ain't been there. but i heard him say. hollywood holiday inn. kinda easy to remember.
i've found ackland!
you'd be breaking the law.
oh god.  i'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you.
now where's she goin'? --
so you slept o.k.?
to who?  arthur?  nothing.  nothing that norman doesn't already know.
yeah, but i can't be sorting through that shit in the middle of a burglary. there's just not time for it.
i'd give five years of my life to see the old country again, the greenfields, and the river, and the old round tower, and the burying place.
no way.
if everybody agrees, but to make a roast takes four hours.
thanks, jabez -- i really wouldn't need very much ... if you could let me have some seed to start off with enough for spring planting ...
i didn't know that.
no. try a little higher.
no.
yeah?
different charge. i had a still. made my own mescal.
certainly!
good god almighty, bless your bones.  but the problem grows.
i'm not sure i can.
you loaded it, vince! i saw you!
what did you do tonight?
the milkmaids.
what's that like?
okay. soon? do you think i'm too fat?
but, paulie, please.
but why be so concerned about me?
me? no. rich food - it kills me. ever try and fly after one of those heavy sauces?
the junior pathologist at ashford hospital. then the husband of a colleague of mine, then a trainee radiologist, then the service manager at my garage.
i - i don't think you have, herr director. not yet. i mean, it's quite n - of course, i'll show it to you immediately.
he's very excited about it.
<u>hit those wipers, ross</u>.
i don't care about rocks, i care about <u>you</u>.  you bring him back in one piece, or you can forget being best man.
no, they won't - honestly.
one lousy letter eighteen months ago. . . .i try to throw a fuckin' case your way ...
tomorrow?
cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy?
thank you, eve.
and your father?
yeah, well we're still a little young for albany state prison. are you pissed about al? i'm pissed too, but i'm not like "twenty-five to life" pissed.
i don't know! i don't know either!
you think that mebbe we're fishin' the wrong stream?
come, we have a boat waiting.
do you have to ask?
ed, you've got to snap out of this. bela's dead -- <u>you're not</u>!
yeah, real fine.  especially all the casualties.
well, you have your story, i have mine.  i say i entrusted the money to you, and you stole it.
nah. i've tried. my writing's too technical, i think. problem of being a journalist too long is you stop giving yourself permission to invent. i better just stick to making pictures.
thanks, old buddy.  i'll be with you in a second.
you can be a leech -- you know this -- and it's boring. you can be quite boring.
really?
i was talking about the girl.
i couldn't get to her.  it all happened so fast.  logan had her, and i saw him fall...then peter told me to run.  and then he...and i remember so clearly, thinking it's me they want.  if i run, maybe they'll come after me.  maybe they won't think about her... so i ran...
it's over a month.    the police say it happens all the time.
thank you, dad.
i got beat up. they...  they broke my thumbs.
of course they'll notice it. but look--  this is a good place for something.
fine.
we're not sure.
you - you killed him?
really?
you do things the hard way, don't you?
what d'you know about how joanna felt?  you went off to an office every morning and you'd come dragging home at seven or eight every night and as long as dinner was on the table you thought everything was swell.
oh, no. that was written by mr ludwig van beethoven.
let glenn deal with the snoop, while we're off livin' the good life.
that's nice.
where'd they take you to?
what the hell does that mean?
these'll keep it cold.
i should only kill people after i get to know 'em?  six billion people on the planet, you're getting bent out of shape 'cause of one fat guy?
yeah.
the academy is fantastic... of course, they won't teach you anything about flying you don't already know.  most of the instructors are very conservative pilots.  you can fly circles around them... but there is a lot on the scientific side that is down-right amazing, and you get a lot of discipline... but after you graduate, don't join the star force -- go free-lance.  it's the only way to get into the action... i can't wait until my hitch is up.
yes i do. my family owns it. it's ours. you don't belong here.
you know what.
no, it isn't, lamar.  there was nothing anyone could do.
usually they take clothes.
that's it, i am just stupid teenager, yes?
nothing but net?  could be a swish.  or a muthafucking air ball.
whatever blows your hair back.
well -- when did you decide all this?
of course... well yeah, a bit. "sin city" by the flying burrito brothers is an all-time top five, but i wouldn't play it at the club.  it's a country-rock ballad.  everybody'd go home.
a .45--
i can see that. why?
i think so. the airport's going to be crawling with police. traffic will be a nightmare. go down to the bar. if they pull it off, great. have someone deal with ashby.
what's with the eyelids?
cheer up buddy buddy. you shook gekko the great's hand and you still got all your fingers. he's not the only elephant in the jungle.
i can't imagine who did it. i can't think of any enemies i have.
aramis -- the king wishes to see you.
maybe he's building a bomb...just like-!
i've never asked you to explain yourself - because you used to let me inside!  but i'm on the outside now...  you put me there!
i don't like it.
funny guy.
well, give me two then, ma'am.
what did we say about lying?
i'm honored.
of course he is ...  -- he's yours too.
i will be with you, like this. forever.
you don't work there anymore, bobby.
damn! how's it look?
you know what i mean.
forget him.  he'll remain with his whores until someone calls him.  you need to worry about people like <u>otho</u>.  there are a lot of phony trance mediums.  they usually can't make the formulas work, but if otho stumbles on the right words in that handbook... he could hurt you.  as in -- <u>exorcism</u>.
what do you love so much?
you look mighty familiar to me.  you sure you're not from around here?
nobody likes garbage -- anyway, this girl with the dirty mouth wasn't bad lookin', but the guys wouldn't take her out for any serious datin'.
i ain't fuckin' sure, bobby.
whoa.  that is one unbelievable piece of eyefuck.
yes, betty.  but the false promise of a new dawn is usually followed by a most bloody sunset.
thank you.
no.
alright, alright.
uh -- yes. seventeen. yes, i -- well no, i -- i never really... there's a place i go now, the cutest little place near my apartment in greenwich village. it's called ann's 440. it's a beatnik bar.
yes, sir.  but so do we.
good to see ya.  william would you...
i hope i helped you out.
well, wait a minute. you married him.
he is.  only tommy wants to prove the legend is true...  ...you stay put.  and i'm not kidding.
yeah.
madonna's in penthouse?
bones... can you give me a quadrant bi-scan?
please.  it's my job.
understood!
he didn't have my lawyer.
okay, um, so it's lloyd and... uh... uh... let's go out.  do you wanna go out?
i mean, dammit, where you live?
that's not the play.  omar'll get a shot off.  i can still talk to him, nate, i just need time.
and you must be mr. massey.
they all lead to the same place -- the lungs.
i'm not going.
what for?
all right.
i intend no slight to you, but i cannot find the english to adequately express just what he is.  i suppose western mythology would describe him as a fury.
yes, i have. i will.
mrs. robinson. if that's the best we can do let's just get the goddamn clothes off and --
v'ger will comply if the carbon units disclose the information.
i don't think so, sir.  in fact... i think he's a cop.  maybe not lapd, but definitely a badge.
negative five?
this?  it's from a thrift shop.
same as we -- they pray.
wait here?  so cheeco can bite my ass off?  tell me where it is i'll do it.
why get rid of her at al1? you've used the coffer of shadow too much.  it is beginning to rule your heart.
well, please keep me fucking informed!
yes, sire.
will you be in atlanta for a while? i'm not buggin' you about coming home, i just wondered.
only the agency of servants.
here.
warren!
i very much doubt that he will.
i understand he's hardly had a life of his own since he left the show.  how did you convince him--was it the opportunity to be close to truman again?
tens of thousands killed before sundown.  nobody's killed that fast since hiroshima and nagasaki.  did you bat an eye, max?  join amnesty international?  no.  i off one angeleno, you throw a hissy fit...
oh great, tell her that! now she really thinks we're problem drinkers!
i can't do anything to make you stay? these people annoy you, isn't that it?
they have?  thank you, max.  tell mr. demille i will be on the set at once.
sailor ain't a murderer. you got to get off that kick. and far's i can tell, sailor was entire clean prior to that involvin' lula. even there he was protectin' her. you oughta be thankin' him for that. that bob ray lemon they say was comin' after the both of 'em. why am i tellin' you this, you was around that night. you ought to know just exactly what happened. sailor just got a little too forceful is all... you remember that night...
helen got it for me in oslo.
the cartoon or her majesty's absenteeism?
come on, don't you screw with her, please!  you... you got to want this: armored car job.  caltrust bank. they took two million in cash...
you've got a lot to lean about homicide, jeff. morons have committed murder so shrewdly that it took a hundred trained police minds to catch them. that salesman wouldn't just knock off his wife after dinner, toss her in a trunk and put her in storage.
i'm not going anywhere, ted. you're the one with the champagne wishes and caviar dreams.
mostly it feels like driving.  you digging for buried treasure?
joseph harbin's body was found in the coffin.
what kind of person?
only he wasn't carryin' no pistol this time.
yeah, uh, just a minute
go ahead.
never mind! just play dead.
egon and i have been working on a gauge to measure psychomagnetheric energy in gevs - giga electron volts.
future wife? get real, man -- you're nothing more than a glorified brother in her eyes.
he heard that.
that's just it.  he never did time. seems each arrest was botched for one reason or another.  judge threw out the cases each time.  either he's got a horseshoe up his ass or powerful friends.
i'm standing next to kayleigh, my hands are over her ears.
marry me instead.
your dad's a doctor.  call him --
i'm a little tired and it's just a pick-me-up.
then the tooth fairy named the book in the part lecktor tore out.
maura.
esther!
absolutely!
why not? there's been a murder.
you're such a ball-breaker sometimes.  especially at night.
i don't recall siberia being this warm, steed.
paul it's telly. open up.
i need your help--
poor baby.
you? the brick?
i love you.
shut up--i like this song...  april in paris, this is a feeling, no one can ever reprieve...
deal the cards.
you should have gone to china. i heard they give away babies like free ipods. they shoot 'em out of those t-shirt guns at sports events.
he's here, sheriff.
oh, surely one can have a tiny touch.
where's my name?
maude, do you think you can help me?
the one superman wrecked up?
what's the reading?
ah, that's nice. they have many convenience stores there for you to stand in front of.
that room!
tom, i love you!  see!  i bought it for him, for his birthday.
you can be a thief and have a conscience.
i don't know.  perhaps i remember something.
i can't help it. i'm just weak, i guess.
i'm frightened.
please don't take any notice of this weapon, major.  i love all weapons, and as of late, i've just taken to keeping a loaded weapon nearby at all times.
it wasn't even his terrible taste. it was his daughter's.
don't ask me, but he's on his way.
i wish i could believe that, doctor.
jesus, what a rude person...
no... be dark before we get there. you wanna see the grand canyon at night?
that's besides the point. the point is if i'd had any sense in me i'd have divorced your mother 40 years ago, and that's the truth, and here it is, 1972 --
damn. he called my roommate and told her he had some important things he wanted to go over with me in his office tonight.
love, you can still write to each other.
it's still taking too long. the people used to snap to.
i cannot go with you.
pregnant.  thanks for asking.
if you don't get out of here, i'll slap that fresh mouth of yours.
if it's the british minister, take him around to the pantry and give him some madeira --
what's wrong with her.
well, uncle pete said you was the goddamndest meanest sonofabitch ever lived an' if i ever wanted a partner for a killin', you was the worst one. meanin' the best. on account of you're cold as snow an' don't have no weak nerve nor fear.
jabez -- seems  like i've been hearing talk around. reverend harper thinks more cross corners folk oughter be in church, sabbath morning.
why should i tell you.
before you?  whoo-hoo!
no.
did sidney tell you about it?
you are never, never to touch my guns!  do you understand!?
chaos.
good night.
not at all --
not if i have anything to say about it.
if you don't want it, give it back.
my pleasure.
i wouldn't know.  that time he caught me was a accident.  i led with my right.
and when they're done laughin' , they're gonna call the cops.  that guy angelo would rat on you for a nickel!
they hurt his head.
let me ask you something, do you really think marty had you assigned to arson because of your firefighting skills? who the hell are you kidding? i was there, remember? i saw you and your brother --
what the fuck was that?!
aw, buddy, i don't care about that.
what? when did it happen? your dad and i always expected you two to get married.
no, it's no good---you can't practice--- you only get one go. a thing like that. no. sure you don't want a sip of this? it's delicious, i think.
shut up, diego.  they're going to be here any minute.  i'm trying to concentrate.
too hot. don't do it. don't come in.
the grandson of victor 'fronkonsteen'?
we know who stole the missing item. if the thief returns it, i'm sure sir te will pursue the matter no further.
but there is no possibility he would have taken his own life?
agnes it had nothing to do with the hand of god. he did a terrible thing to you, do you understand?
the point being:  he's also a candidate for my job.  if we can pull this off, maybe i can restore their faith in me.
lewis gilbert.
looks to me like your out of business. now i want some answers.
we have his note.
then luca turned to the other man...
you know, it's interesting. the south lost the civil war, but they still seem to get all the glory.
c'mon.
i can't tell.
well... you can talk to a beautiful woman at a bar without worrying if anyone's watching you.
i'll protect you, dollface.
please.  just listen.  i know why you're here, neo.  i know why you left your family and your friends, why you left your home to come to this city.  you're looking for him.
...the minute you start your engines ...it's goint to kill us, isn't it?
i'll rule on that presently.   proceed.
yes.
i like that...
a lifetime of petty crime climaxed by your sleaziest accomplishment yet...  blackmailing a national hero...
i have attorneys.  they have friends.  i have friends.  money buys you a lot of attorneys and friends.
then why?
look at my face.  it's the face of the people who did that.  my father hardly speaks english.  we're in bad trouble, you have to see that.
i confirmed it on the scanner. i knew something was up because puffy used to bark like hell whenever he saw him and you know puffy only barks at bad people.
no. but does it make any difference?  how did you get to be the way you are?
oh, come on--you and grandma think anybody who works with their hands is a peasant. when dad--
just a coincidence?
now don't give me that deep shit now.  don't start with that shit.
excuse me?
just follow me.
i know.
can we make the jack-o-lantern now?
what are you talking about?
larry, you've got to tell her.
the lenape.  he comes to gawk at civilization from time to time.
no...
coffee's warming me up.
i've eaten.
what?
unfortunately no -- to bad -- tomorrow though.
thank you, miss boatwright.
i kind of like you tellin' me what to do and not to do. just like my daddy. i didn't mind him tellin' me. i hate doyle to tell me what to do. mama said the only way to ever get away from him is for him to get away from us. that we can't leave him or he'll try and hurt her.
i'm not touchy, i just, it's a silly question, that's all.  am i happy?  are you happy?
i want to go back to the clock people. i kind of miss those fool redskins and wonder what they're up to. what's happened to jelly?
what?
bear with me here...
which o'higgins do you know?  for i have never heard your name mentioned in my family.
beer, please.
not that again...
mother!
he was the only one done right. two in the back of the head.
are you a man?
i'd really feel stupid if we didn't bring anything back home.
*homer* liked it!  didn't you?
what's your interest in this, mr. bergman?
hmmmm... after you left, it was difficult, and then lily -- that's your mother -- she took ill and died... we haven't shown a picture since forty-eight.
fine.
you'd suffer in her stead?
the mask.
i tell you, the soldiers were provoked.  now stop this pussyfooting around.  dead kids!  how the hell did we ever give the democrats a weapon like this?  i mean, if cambodia doesn't work, we'll bomb hanoi if we have to.
i said i'm trying to reach talby. something's wrong with the damn intercom. i need a last-minute diameter approximation.
no... what i mean is... i'm just very excited by the prospect of getting on with my life, that's all.
yeah.
like having a pint in the metro --
joe, listen—
good morning, dr. zira.
really? you think this is its way of saying "hi there" to the people of the earth?
stick up?
what plane?  we going someplace?  where we headed?  you have your money.  it's all there.  what the fuck is going on?
how old is he?
nikko?
give me a yell is something happens.
no way.  everybody's going sailing. if you don't want to take me, just say so.
no, i'm not.
the hotel, the casino.  the corleone family wants to buy you out.
yeah, he was picked up-- also the body from the morgue. say, what did you have to do with stealing that body?
you used his credit card.
but
yeah, i <u>could</u>, but the thing is, if later got here sooner, it would be...better.
no, no ... i did that...
my name is emmett.
three legs.
remove him at once.
so... nice ship you got here. what's our next move?
the d.a. came down here last night ready to arraign before they even moved him to county. kint's lawyer comes in and five minutes later, the d.a. comes out looking like he'd been bitch-slapped by the boogey man. they took his statement and cut him a deal.
not my birthday again?
ah, doctor's ethics. if you knew you wouldn't tell, huh?
what?
oh yeah? you pick up the watch?
faith.
yeah.
jesus christ, stanley, you can't go to the bathroom now.  you have exactly one minute before we're back on the air, this is not the time to go to the bathroom.
i'll...take it straight.
he has about twenty-eight bucks... it's all he has on him.
this gonna get you in trouble?
no.
yes. to hamunaptra. to perform the ritual.
i can extend that.  there's some storage tanks outboard on the wrecked module.  i'll have to go outside to tie onto them.
well... 'bye.
all last night he could have been--
yes.
you don’t say.
i've got my father coming through tomorrow anyway.  i should get some sleep.
it's nice to see you.
you ask me that counselor's making a mountain out of a molehill...
but you don't know yet, so your negativity's a bit premature, wouldn't you say?
and may i ask what could possibly be more important than fawell oil v. u.s. environmental agency?
i came through for you, mom and the butterflies, dad.
you're not old. you look great.
i'm cooking pasta primavera.
-- but this time they bombed him and then cremated the body.
that is a picture, nothing more.
right.  i love you, frank.
before i do --  i was hoping we might be alone, bill.
fine.  how's your back?
that was two days ago. frankly, i think this place is a bit boring. it's all white. why doesn't the guy put up some posters? maybe some bullfight things . . .
dammit...  i told them no mayo.  see - - i could veto this simpson garner thing, but i really don't want to do that...
so are you.  i mean you're a neat guy. we better get back.
do you?
that's okay, that's okay, just shut the door.
it's been wiped down a hundred times since then.
the v.l.a.?
not us.  not human.  get it?  something non- human, but intelligent...
shit, man, tha' ain't even worth considerin'.
yes.
nesting, huh? are you planning to build the crib out of twigs and saliva?
i know the feeling.
let's try to keep your i.q. a family secret, leonard. before we launch him against superman, we have to test him ... see how well he does with mayhem and destruction. kind of a coming out party under the glare of media covering the metro club gala. and once he proves himself, then . . .
looks don't concern me, maestro. only talent interests a woman of taste.
i have a job for you and i don't have much time.
lenny, you can't trust a man's life to your little notes and pictures.
a cure?
ahhh, but i know you.
yeah -- na trang told me to expect you -- we'll see what we can do. just stay out of my way till this is done, captain.
i guess i'd ask you why.
anyone else?
do you like massage?
i pull over and kick your ass out, man!
we were satisfied.
please.  now i've forgotten how many spades are out.
the readings suck....
never mind.
we leave it.
don't you never say that --  -- you guys talk like that in front of a little girl -- you guys are scum.
i can get you out of here.
you should've seen me take my last runner... perfect.  i backed him up against a residence pool and when he terminated... his hand...  so now you've seen him... what's the difference awake or asleep?
you're kidding.
yes.
must i? well, i won't! i tell you straight: i will not!
those scumsuckers are my radials, pham!
just me.
mm-hmm.
let's see.  where's it from?
what? she asked about my father?
but the bridge has been pulled down!
earl asked me, linda, please, linda, i'm sorry -- earl asked me --
who the hell is lucy delaney?
stop finishing...
proud?  any jerk with a gun can kill someone.
listen you stupid fuck, i want my car.
you did kill those men.
your insight is enlightening.
never say anything unless you have to.
yeah, uh, i got some pretty good leads...
we gotta talk.
but now i kind of like it.
martin, would you run me an atmospheric?
they did it last year too. it's like traditional or something. they've got this humongoid park ave apartment and she just holes up there with a wad of cash.  aren't the hugely wealthy sad?
you have a little boy.  he shows you his butterfly collection, plus the killing jar.
detour.  other way's blocked...
please. i want to see you home. all right?
come in out of the rain.  in the morning we'll have both our stories for breakfast.
marion, stop this.
oh jeez, benjie. well, here you are.
telly is at steven's?
no, well go if you want to, but don't talk to the police about my face -- they find out he hit me -- he's got a temper -- he could've hit freddie.  good luck, marge. i'll catch up with you later.
because he's not forty feet tall.  the safe was up on the ceiling, remember?
i wasn't looking for a brawl.  i came to bring him a present.  wanna bite to eat?
frances! frances!
you know what that will mean for lombardo.
you know what i'm gonna do.
i'm carrying quite a large sum in travelers checks. how much of a deposit would you like?
forget about him being god, he's thirty feet long, he <u>is</u> a miracle of nature, who somehow made his way to maine.  this is a grand beast. <u>a</u> <u>grand</u> <u>dragon</u>.  an attempt should at least be made to capture him alive.
i don't know.
who are they? lieutenant, get those people away from there.
for starters. it's also got fennel, asparagus, olives, some more of mother nature's aphrodisiacs... back in college, me and my roommates used to call it hard- on stew.
all right. meet me at the juicy-juice juice bar after work today and i'll spill my goddamn guts for you.
i see.
may i finish?
we've got another two hours of daylight.
no, i'd be imposing on her, i'd be just another tongue-tied gushing fan...
huh?
police are still searching through the debris. could be days before we find her . . . that is, if she's even there.
you're nothing to me now, fredo; not a brother, not a friend, i don't want to know you, or what happens to you.  i don't want to see you at the hotels, or near my home.  when you visit our mother, i want to know a day in advance, so i won't be there.  do you understand?
i was at a cocktail party.  very trendy.  andrew was in chicago on business.  he had broken his wrist the week before and was wearing it in a sling.  he looked so helpless.
just got hired today!
you say something?
he takes a razor from his dinky little dopp kit, cuts his fingertip, takes my hand, does the same to me...
i'm trying to buy you a suit.
--christ almighty--
did you --
thanks. i made them by hand.
i love you too... too late... too late...
that's not true.
you are?
i get off for lunch in ten minutes. can i treat you to a hamburger?
no.
no, thanks i've got a... a date tonight-
i don't rightly know, sir.
who -- that guy at the zoo?
he say we like the same thing as married.
how long? i don't know, see what the doctor says ...
and i got a stitch stuck between my teeth, jerked my head back and the whole fucking stump fell off.
i won't have to.
9:30's almost 10:30.  where i come from, the sun's over the yardarm, m'boy, and the cocktail lamp is lit.
no. i have a cellmate. his name's carl.
it would be the beginning of the end for my family.  how can i keep all my other territories in like if i let two wise-guys stand up and demand this and that, and then give it to them?
welcome to the caribbean, love.
every damn day.
what do you want me to do?  scream?  i don't think it would help much.  i'm just gonna sit back, take it easy, and wait for you to screw up.
yeah. a raise . .
there's no way out of the zone. no one's ever escaped. that's why they send the criminals here.
it was an unfair fight. he didn't have a chance. i'm taking a real gamble. i loved him for a long, long time.
yeah...?
i needed to feel alive.  i wanted to do something...  outrageous. and... i don't know... it felt good to be needed.  to be trusted.  to be special.
the whole joint is half the size of rhode island.
no costume.  no blackface.
no, no. don't call the police!  just tell him i'm on the phone with you... my name is lowell bergman... just tell him that.
no. it's you who doesn't understand, aud. halfdan has come to kill and destroy. we brought him here. we must stop him.
a farmer, eh! you're a moocher, that's what you are! i wouldn't believe you or anybody else on a stack of bibles! you're a moocher like all the rest of them around here, so get out of here!
hey, smart ass, how 'bout i kick your butt?
very good, chief. chief guard turns to alex.
doll, you and waski run on, too.
i'm not quite sure how this works. my brother...
so why's he do it?
your honor, i'm only examining the man's employment record.  he pretends to fitness when he cannot hold a job.
deal.
what?
how's that?
hi.
there you go.
leo spanked a waitress?
his mixture got screwed up.  he panicked and pranged his regulator.
have you ever thrown up in the front row of a richard marx concert?
shit! shit!
don't say that.
no!  it's nothing!  just nothing! you always told me to tell the truth.  you think you can just turn that off?
okay, willard, sit down.
so you're breaking up with me because you're afraid your family won't like me?  everybody likes me!
well, it isn't "cigarettes are bad for you"...
because i can't bear to watch. when they lose, i die inside. it's like some little person named steve just crumples up and dies. i wait for the scores. i still die, hearing the scores, but it's over in a second. i can't survive the game pitch by pitch, inning by inning. i've done it too many times. and i can't do it anymore.
woman friends, too?
you know who i am.
he knows.
i am.
you know, dah--
ford, do you got something cooking in the microwave?
harry!
i don't mean anything by it.
i'll see you after the doctor has a look at your leg, mr. gardiner.
i thought it was taylor's case?
ummm...
she's gone, gone to town. she hated working on the farm...  ...just like you.
joseph miller, your honor. macready and shilts legal services.
there's your old twenty-gauge, and that there's the new browning you was showing me last night. this must be twombley's gun. brand new. very fancy tooling. probably fired one time. it's a beautiful piece of work.  but what the hell, jack, i guess you deserve it. right's right.
and smooth... almost no movement - back and forth, i mean.
just give me a chance, will you?
that means you like me!
such nonsense, what do you all take me for - little nell from the country? been my understudy for over a week without my knowing, carefully hidden no doubt-
see, i knew you'd be mad.
turn it off....
it's not that easy.
i'll honk four times so you'll hear it and know she's on her way up. okay?
hard to judge how these things happen. the parole board almost never reverses their decisions.
fueled and waiting.
allowed me to travel from my time to yours.
i say, it wouldn't be fair to you... or to me.
danny, i'm touched.
no.
the district attorney's office will comply provided -
you'd have to get me inside.  get inside, watch where the money's moving, see where the guards are going. then i could work with your map.
i'm sorry. i'll get my things.
weirder than this?
but how could you say such a thing?
it's like they knew they were going to kill everyone before they went in...
but max, she needs me.  it could mean life or death.
yeah.
no.  i'd want to--
good-day, miss winch. i advise you to get some steam up - before you run aground.
too bad. the thorwalds were just leaving the apartment house at that time.
gets you where you live, huh?
the americans themselves have made it possible.  we will annihilate them in a single attack -- at pearl harbor.
i do love you.  let's get lost together.
can i see what you have so far?
no.  i told you everything, you lied to me.  i would have done anything for you.
i feel much better now.
and whose houses do you design...?
come on. you're seriously trying to tell me the japs can't find los angeles without my headlights?
what kind of a silly thing was that to do?
although mr. huntington makes an excellent point, i have to wonder if the defendant kept a thorough record of each sperm emission made throughout his life?
well, you're real sweet to make it for me.  there never was nobody like you. and you don't need to worry, i ain't goin' out no more.
where's your dad?
i don't know.  i guess i needed something...
not having that, which, having, makes them short.
why, doctor.  i did.  he was a bad dog.
tell me what to do, carl.  i need guidance, not a fucking platitude.  i'm not bringing a child into the kind of life i grew up with.  i won't do it.  i want our life back.
what happened to them?
"my dream date with principal collins."
justin?
yes.
you're not going anywhere. you're 15 years old!!
now, wait a minute! i'm not afraid of anything. what were you going to write about williams?
i don't buy the whole recluse scam. how are you doing it?  what is it -- drugs?  blackmail?  mind-control? all three?  what do you do -- keep her locked in a box somewhere?
does this mean what i think it means?
i was a great beauty.
what?
hi, dad.
if spielburg can direct "the color purple" and "amistad", our whiz kid can direct the mantan pilot.
athos, please...!
are you calling her?
i'm all right.
i've got my seahaven bankcard.
well, physiologically, he...	won't quite fit.
i can still see the shoreline. the moon is rising.
i see.  mr. franklin, i must ask you and miss hayes to keep this incident with mr. gardiner to yourselves. there's no telling what he was involved in, and the matter may be extremely confidential. so please, not a word.
don't act like you've never committed a crime before, hawkins?  i know, i made call, when anna tracked me down i...
i have lava.
what is this?  that's my money. you tryin' to muscle me?
oh, rosie.
after getting laid?
how could i forget?  oh, sure, i remember you.
oh...
twenty-one-years-old, ladies and gentlemen; four of those years spent accomplishing some rather extraordinary things at one of our nation's leading seats of learning --
we all know you're gonna get over with the insurance money anyway! ya know da deal.
if i say go to two, it's really one.
that's right.
what is he doing here?
i get a little bloated sometimes.
maybe you should go buy yourself some clothes.
i have dissolved the senate.
apple pie...  mcdonald's or homemade?
you ask him if you like, but i would leave him to it if i was you.
it was still alive when you buried it?
it's a lot more stressful than i thought.
he strained his leg so that it pains him to ride. but he sends his greetings -- and says that i speak for all the bruces. and for scotland.
--and you've had some fucking meteoric rise, that's for sure--by the time you turn forty you might be the head of the montana bureau--
i didn't leave you.
well, if there weren't pows before, there are now.
a small thing.  nothing really.
i was talking to another friend of harry's. a baron kurtz - do you know him?
no, we got pressure from california state. the man practically has clemency. we can't run the risk of falsely accusing him. he has to be standing over the victim with knife in hand before we make a move.
keep it down, dude.
oh, it's so nice to meet you.
i want to believe.
my lady viola.
how about this child? you expect *her* to be responsible?
what?
why not?
tell me about it...
thanks, guys.
oh.
re-figure it, mr. bernstein, at two cents.
no. you never worked berlin.
check it out... great huh? i tell you those guys know what time it is. man i'm with that...
...and even then...
mickey told him to call.  'he's some very hotshot surgeon at mass. commonwealth.  he wants to meet with you at seven tonight re testimony in the case of deborah ann kaye.  you meet him at the hospital.'
here's how i see it.  i've got no house, no movie, no gun, and i'm being stalked.  because someone wants to kill me?  no, because someone wants to kill you. so now, starting now, i go where you go.  that way, if someone wants to kill me, i'll be with you, and since they really want to kill you, they won't kill me, they'll kill you.  make sense?
you do.
why don't you think about it for a while?
and if it isn't, why don't we call washington on your telephone? you tell your story, we'll tell ours.
wait. how about this?
i can tell her you're all tied up in the projection room.  i can give her the brush ...
i've searched the entire world for you, buffy.
where is your attacker?
no trouble at all.  hawkeye.
david ... in a free society information is the name of the game. you can't win the game if you're a man short.
oh -- you would!
and larry?...
well, i --
i made a mistake hiring you- you're simply not up to the job. 
like hell. play the goddamn tape.
i'll be back.
calculated risk.  only we happen to know, j.j., that you like me.  i'm your star pupil -- i reflect back to you your own talent.
that was a later invention, it's not in the scrolls.... anyway, the jews know where the sentences end. they know the whole thing by heart. every word. every letter.
shut up!  fo' i pump this glock in yo' ass!  what did you do wit day-day and roach?
well, everyone's entitled to their opinion.
yeah, well, i'm bored, bear. i wanna make movies.
you don't know me. you don't know me!  so fuck you. fuck you.
holy toledo! that's six years ahead of schedule!
how soon?...
let me be the judge of that, madam.
go ahead.
shut up, miss henried! i tol' ya b'fore!
why, with you.
i know, i know....
well it's... it's a defense mechanism.
thanks.
it's for men.
about freddy?
mr. danvers called. i'll get a new one with the insurance money. b.f.d.
you see the army leaving and you see the loss of a tool. i see a power void to be filled. as we have the most power, we may move with impunity.
fire!
well, he agreed 100% that bob should be dropped. and he also agreed you were a liability. but he felt his talent would make up for your weaknesses.
i suppose.
you can handle this.
oh...
well, you're doin' shit-hot at intel.
you're saying i have no choice.
salt's good for you, ted.  helps you from getting impotent.
i've got the grands for two nights, charlie.  you can't just --
never mind.  i want a tent.
what i am.
what should we do, sir? the time is running out.
you really enjoy my company?
don't go to the bar, ray. i know him, that ain't a good idea.
no change. the minute you open the door, he goes into his act.
show uncle ricky what you made.
just giving the facts.
sorry to track you down like this. i'm not a stalker. but i needed to see you.
where's scully?!
dallas. korben dallas.
roach, what are you doing?
that's easy: 6 inches. we carry stuff that big in stock.
may i interrupting?
little rum in yours, too?
i thought the same thing, right off the bat. that's why we went to see the doctor.  but hunh-uh.  turns out one's got nothing to do with the other.
like cats and dogs.
son of a god<u>damned</u> bitch!  been waiting there all this time.  how the hell's it even know we're still here?
don't you see?  i had to make it right. i ignored my mother's crossing.  i sat with them all.  i held their hands.  i stroked their hair.  i was with them to the end.  i took away the blood.  i washed them.  their crossing was peaceful.
i'm sorry, son, but you must have me confused with someone else. my name is roger murdock. i'm the co-pilot.
it's not for me.  it's for my dad.  i think he needs a new wife.
...oh jesus, what the fuck...?
do you remember your epictetus, that little homily we recited when we were children?  the one that was supposed to remind us we were romans?
i can't help it.  he gives me the creeps... i mean why was suzie so scared of him?  she's not that way.  i think he did something...
me? oh, you mean my body. don't worry, doc -- it'll go to the university -- i'll put it in writing --
okay.  cottage number three.
reilly, what the hell happened out there? why didn't you call for back-up?
i like steak.
tom, we're going to be legitimate all the way, and you're the legal man.  what could be more important than that.
he's right.  we hit the bricks, we walk back triple-fucked.
want some free advice?
maybe. what about all those hairs they found on his body?
let's shut up and not kill her.
erica? she said she was tired. she went back to the hotel.
it's not gonna be easy. your brothers can possess people. so they probably won't look like themselves. you have to be suspicious of everyone.
what's up, dixie chicken?
i stole them.
it will be human and it will look like this.  but when it comes it will know everything i know and everything you know. that is something from my planet that i want your baby to have.
you should a joined us, everett. it couldn't a hurt none.
the secret of the grail has been safe for a thousand years. and for all that time the brotherhood of the cruciform sword has been prepared to do anything to keep it safe.
...there's nobody.
well, bully for that nigga. you say she wants to give me the money, huh?
did you bring that tape?
that's tough.
go away.
you ordered a winnebago?
wild doesn't exactly cover it.
lets throw another log on the fire.
well, that's very nice. thank you.
ripley...
no, the last time was three years ago.
you could say that. and friedman left this morning for los angeles.
i gotta go to the bathroom.
invitations?
-- christ, viktor, look around. what do you think pays for all this?  this is about investment and return.  those days in new york... that's... it's over.
nah. i'm... i'm nothing.
i like you. i like you. i been telling you all night, i like you...
you need to get outta here, rapunzel
i don't know!  shit, give me a break!
oh, you know, it's uh... it's in the little fridge in your room.
emily, you -
-- well, if you feel like playing, go play...
i wanna live with them too.
yes!
then i think we're due the reward you offered... and it had better be substantial after what we've been through.
please, gabriel, don't...
oh. what are you talking about for christ sake! did you see her or not? she's acting like a fucking out of her mind psychotic or a split personality or...
these people will pay you ten thousand before and ten thousand after. they want someone they can be sure of, an honest dealer. that's the point. not all dealers are honest. mr reynolds will never suspect you.
yeah, right.  anyway, that scene where warren beatty and faye dunaway get shot?  i remember thinking at the time it wouldn't be a bad way to go, if you have to.
who's that!
she belongs to all of us.  she is the future queen and ruler of all kingdoms on earth.
slow down.
you won't even tell us?
david --
the next time i walk into a bank.
you try to frighten me, sir, admit so, sir. this is some new form of torture. say it, brother, sir.
so far?
i'm glad you came to me for help.
then i have no idea.
got it.  nice touch.  okay, pick me up at eight.  the de-brief is at ten hundred.
you mean when are you going to egypt?
sure.  bases loaded.
what happened to them?
lead mine.
again
time for a champion.  can you do more than pick acorns and rob bird's nests, jack?
with pleasure. won't you sit down?
no.  i'm just a little tired.
you can.
sorry.
jackson, looks like you got elias' squad now.
no, laddie.  it was a <u>memory</u>.
you believe in the boogey man?
sure dad.
-is it, i'm sorry, but then, of course, you're the doctor, you should know.
ok, ok. you guys just go back in. dad, keep going with the toast, we'll be right in. go on.
it has everything.
yes.
include me out.  i've had enough of the conversations.
let me explain. no. i'll do better than that. i'll show it to you. scientifically. but it's demonstration purely in the interest of science, you understand?
that's a first. most people praised me for it.
ten million --
working the net isn't that different from ordinary undercover work. you go into the community, walk their walk, talk their talk, gain their confidence.
i swear to god, i'll fucking puke.
yah.
she leads a charmed life, that little one ... someone is always there to save her. in the palace as a child, on the train and now ... it's him.
fucking tigers. they got no pitching except for a bunch of green kids straight out of double a or southern cal.  how was the party?
what's 'incidentals?'
"embezzling" is such an ugly word, mister bailey...  no, actually i'm trying to get a legal brief together.
i want you to come.
come here, might as well fix that arm.
yes i do.  i love it.  don't you?
serious. but you'll have to take your new friend, the female crash-test dummy. she dropped it off for you.
topol.
check this out.  y'know sal's.
maybe you should, but you can't.
you guys have been so colossal...
what are you doing in baker? didn't you get my telegram?
it's good with coffee.
you live pretty good.
it'll be even shorter if i get that new job.  come on.
-- look, you don't have to entertain me...
i'd keep away from him.
pull the cash.
we're not going to wait here like cornered animals.  i can tell you that.  we need help.  i'm going to talk to that little girl.
what do you want?  encouragement?  'gosh, buffy, you're so special, i just want to give you a great big hug, oh i'm just having a warm fuzzy.'
where did you get that?
...i'm not finished yet, mom.
don't threaten me, bob.
i miss him too.
and what was that neighbor guy doing here?
don't ask stupid questions.  look at it.
you what?
you remember before you picked him up -- when you looked up at the sphere, you remember that -- when the sphere opened?  that's right.  but you can't remember going inside, can you?  no, of course not.  harry couldn't either, could he?  "like everything's on the tip of my tongue", he said.
i like it fine here.
sure. as long as she don't mind.
i know what i know.
i think you both know my director of genetic research, susan storm.
how about that.
i know it sounds easy. but something happens between the time i hear the line and the time i'm suppose to jrepeat it.
can't wait, pal, can't wait.
... that's what he's here for, isn't he?
couldn't you tell a man like that when you saw him?
and they frighten you?
when did you start smoking?
please.
c'mon, seymour, please?
ain't he warning up?
christ!  wes, tell him.  you know this stuff.
i hope you don't mind that i took so long to finish.
a teleprompter.
you've got to face the things you feel.
no.
delmar what the hell are you talking about? - we got bigger fish to fry-
eh, don't take out me lines.
nearly four years...
walt disney, who gave us snow white and the seven dwarfs, plays shuffleboard.  jesus christ plays shuffleboard.
not a very good one, but--
thank you, alfred.  i hope you'll excuse me.  it was a great pleasure meeting you.  and you.
what makes you so sure it was one?
no more fuckin' for her.
take it.
no, i wouldn't be surprised at anything from you. winningly. maxwell now, honey--you are here in time to help me and you can--
foolin', hell! i would have eaten that dirt for them. they coulda used my head for a shovel and a my face for a broom... they just never did get a piece of my mind.
at the point -- i don't -- look you'd be on tv maybe one or two times each. i'11 try to avoid i'11 go out of my way to avoid, getting together with you. believe me.
yes, very.
don't know. did you check everywhere? maybe it was hidden in something. maybe there was someone else--
don't tell me, partner.  i'm just a desk jockey who was on the way home when you rang.
tom.
and where do you keep mickey?
that's preposterous!  we have no such program!
i am happy to say that this bag is officially empty.
medicinal marijuana initiative.  or am i being cynical?
what do you mean?
hmm. i'd say eight, maybe nine.
that's it?
well, my pleasure. i could use a little lift myself.
oh, i'm sure i can manage something... "sin city." "new rose," by the damned. "hit it and quit it" by funkadelic. "shipbuilding," elvis costello, japanese import, no horns, or different horns, anyway... um... "mystery train" by elvis presley... and... "spaced cowboy" by sly and the family stone.  a bit controversial, i know, but...
she's already on a plane back home.
sock her!
how many drinks have you had?
you remember daniel zavitz?
really? who's your p.o.?
the pebbles forgive me, the trees forgive me. so why can't you forgive me? i don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
yep.  sleep fast.
oh, god, uniforms, more stress. let her sleep.  it's a self-limiting: she hyperventilates till she passes out, then her breathing goes back to normal, and she wakes up singing like a lark.  we know, don't we, princess?  give her a couple of hours.  i know about this.
don't do this to me now, joel. really.
well, that's out. either it's *lots* of reporters and *lots* of tickets or--. now will you go and call 'em before i change my mind about the whole thing!
absolutely.
for. . . ?
i guess so. i think that's right.
your father must be smart.
i'm not leaving you alone with these assholes.
now i'll have to wait at least a week. if i announced it tomorrow, after what our new chief nurse saw this afternoon, they'd hear her yelling from seoul to washington.
is freddie in rome?
oh, it's all right, beats jew york. but the niggers have took it over, just like every other city we got, only worse.
i'll torture it out of you.
what?
well, what do you think i'm going to do? quit in protest? i'm not going to do that.
no!  this isn't true.  we... we were around other people, together, both of us...
d-90's.  you spend a hundred and twenty-five years on earth, actually, in that house, during which you get only three class- one d-90 intercessions with juno. you probably haven't even read through the manual completely yet.
shhhh...
the alps.
yup.
oh, a little.  but it's not just physical loneliness.  it's the pangs that come from missing someone intellectually... as i have you.
yes.
milo?
she lives in rome, but she does stuff here the smithsonian and has a lot of diplomatic connections, so she has offices				* here.										*
i wanna see that guy!
i waited to get your autograph, but you never came outside.
uh...where...where do you want to go?
wait, this isn't fair...
what happened?
whenever. tonight.
then it's going to be 'i killed for sex'... listen darling, why won't you let us use your real name for the features - if people knew that it was the ellen carter writing the features and not just some pseudonym - then we might shift more units. you haven't written anything in four years darling - i know you need this job - and if circulation keeps dropping, there's not going to be a magazine for you to write for...
playing.
has there been another goddamn rewrite? how  the fuck are we supposed to learn our lines when there's a new script every 15 minutes?
are you jackin' with me?
its true, sheriff.
oh... right...  you know, ever since the stroke...
to have stopped this creature? yes!
i need to see his habitat.
are you queer, mr. lounds?
naw, you missed me, copper. try this on for size.
say, isn't this your twenty dollars?
just a spoiled brat of a rich man. you and westley'll make an ideal team.
10%.  that's ...
i don't believe it.
uh, it's a deep south expression.
the slimy bastard who's going to do it for you.
yes.
after he tried to shoot you?
isn't it already too late then?
pearl and john.
we still got three migs running around and six more on the way.
if somebody deserves respect, mr. pike, they receive it from me, convict or no convict.
oh my god, a mistake!
they're ghosts.  they do what they want.
john! great to see you! sorry about the cunt at reception.
pete, if j. edgar hoover walked in here wearing a dress, i wouldn't know him.
i know that. but i'm --
show me just agatha's data stream.
they were hebrew, weren't they?
if you're for real, you're looking at a million credits for viewing rights alone. doesn't include touring and guest lectures. when can you get them here?
don't worry, we've got everything.
ain't that the truth!  i've even bad producers recut my movies --
because there were a zillion dea guys hanging around the terminal.
it looks like a winding route.
how many times have you shocked him tonight?
hitch-hiking.
i hear you.
i don’t know. could be the sound of jewellery hitting a parquet floor, huh?
you're pretty quick with those numbers. how about the odds of me buying the first round?
why yes. how did you know?
sleep is for the weak, mr. president.
oh, i see.  but you're not luke. you're peter appleton, the picture writer.
does that include helen filmore, united states congresswoman?
it wasn't her mother.  the only reason we're still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party.
yeah, just make sure you do first. let's go, guys.
are you a doctor, too?
that's right.
hey, fuck you.
you are in trouble. now do it.
did marks close the front door?!
may i have a look?
yeah?
take my number.  when you see me -- call me and i'll walk you through the exchange.  it's 308-9962 -- repeat it back.
don't worry.  she's just a fan for my literary output.
you don't have to go this second. you can stay until whenever.
fuck you!! fuck you!!
they're good, norm, but you're better'n them.
he wasn't there.
why?
jews and negros don't win elections, henry.  better to hang them around the democrats' necks.
a new pair of panty hose. is it enough?
uh hey, does anyone wanna see my unit?
i'm meeting a player from temple university. he's a cornerback. you like football?
that's funny: you struck me as the kind of man who always carries protection.
no you don't.
no, i'm not married.  it's for my daughter.
after leizburg, he stuck his neck out to defend me.  he's loyal to the end. even if it's not--politically correct at the time.
late night.  you?
oh, you know... a lot of people aren't too old for clubs but they're too old for acid jazz and garage and ambient and all that.  they want to hear old funk and stax and new wave and old school hip hop and some new stuff all together and there's nowhere for them.
once.
been doing experiments with scotch and soda again?
you don't really believe this?
but grandpa, you said...
not on that leg.
maybe it is.  i wouldn't know.
you shall find me apt enough to that, sir. and you will give me occasion.
i think we sort of found each other.
no shit?
you were gonna ask me weren't you?
first of all...
someday he'll surface and i'll get him for both of you. i promise. i'll find the guy with the scar.
you tit.  i soiled my armour i was so scared!
vincent.  don't make me do this. don't make me get people killed.
no, hold back...
i question the thinking behind sending the first ambassador to another civilization in armed -- basically announcing our intentions are hostile.
how different?
not about coming to see daitz?
having a gun pointed at you for one. it's not like breaking a mirror bad luck, but it's bad. three on a match, black cats... believe it. believe it all.
you stupid punk!  you don't even know what you're fighting over!
it's unbelievable.
why, thank you, tom. i was going to ask you if you thought i could.
gary's not into fiber optics. he's betting everything on the satellites.
come here.
alright, go to the belt store...
the swan was so ridiculous. all the same, it did scare me.
we could show 'em we're friendly, huh?  walk out there with a white flag!  here - i got an old sugar sack in my car!
i'll apologize for everything but today...today i give a shit.
very good, doctor.  i've also detected structural elements, back references, a general movement from the simple to the complex -- all of which would seem to indicate instructions -- an enormously complicated set of instructions -- for building something.
what'd he say?
no hard feelings?
why bother?
what the fuck are you doing?
okay.
a light mixture of oxygen, dioxide, and sodium pentothal.  he'll sleep, that's all.
sure we could run him. you realize he's already head of his block association.
eddie moses, communications attache -- which translated from ancient bullshit means: i work for a messenger service.
i crossed paths with him. that's why i'm trying to stay clear of my neighborhood.  to make sure i don't run into him again.
he's dead?
do what?
-- yeah, honey...
music! turn it up. put that tape on.
what do they know?  i had nine, but i feel through the ice when i was seven, my brother pulled me out.  then i used one when a grenade landed in my foxhole in sicily, it was a dud.  i figure one on the beaches, one on the cliffs and two getting here.
try to communicate with her somehow.
i'm making you a steak.
i am an english woman.
yes.
no, i mean we can't leave without you - we don't know where the hell we are!!
get me air support...  we'll be airborne and assault the ambush...
i can't handle that thing.
i don't want to.
but mr. richards and mr. sampson-
i'm sorry i didn't believe you.
whassamatta?
you got some kind of business with him?
i wasn't satisfied! i suppose i proposed to you!
i mean -- the young lady -- whoever she may be -- it was on the couch when i got home last night.
let's drop it.
because he understood.  that was her life's blood on the stage.
i'd like that.
be right down.
i think it's an energy form, sir...
and where are they now?
that's right, modern times.
how can that be? he was getting better.
who?
it's up.  love gives you wings. you can fly away from here.
did you have a nice time?
my brother had shouldered that burden, allowing me to pursue my own selfish needs.
that girl? no, never saw her. i don't know anybody.
when you saw dr. lecktor's murders, their 'style,' so to speak, were you able to reconstruct his fantasies? and did that help you identify him?
when can i see you?
please accept my apology for not having done so sooner.
ed, you're gonna miss your own premiere.
well, uh, trini and i have an early plane.  we were hoping to get back to new york in time for ...
how could i not?
jackie, what're you doing?
oh, my god, he's a natural.
arbogast.  and after he left?  no, it's okay, norman. how's it been going out there?  well, i think you oughta unload that place and open up closer in to the action, a smaller place, you know... but...
it's... basalt.  rock.
well, are you satisfied now? can we just lie and talk, huh?
good idea - with a boss who's a really ugly son-of-a-bitch.
then you're playing a part for him too, aren't you?  a dangerously self- destructive one.
...art sank, sun set, ark sank again...
i will be here when you return.
wendy...
he's here.
don't wanna register it. i'll call you in a couple days.
and what favour does mr. tilney receive from you?
maybe she used another name.
oh, you're a doctor now, too?
i believe you, austin. let's go.
why do you love me?
thousand dollars a game.
it's all my fault. what have i done, animal? what have i become? look at me. this isn't me. i don't do things like this.
whoa, this was a mistake.
you mean "goodnight."
mph mm!
not what...who.  seems your boyfriend wants people to believe jason has returned.
it's cool!
a well-timed lightning bolt through her window and monday morning, all the other heathers, shit, everybody would be cast fucking adrift.
we were talking about the wild thing. teen promiscuity.
i think i'm goin' to commence dedicatin' myself twice daily. it may come to three times before it's over...
that's two hundred dollars a day? so he can get a hooker and some tequila.  veto, darwin.
twenty-five thousand for clothes and a watch.
i'm sorry.  i didn't mean to.
hey, i'm just waiting for cousin itt to show up.
no.  i didn't.
no more stalemate tom, we got the soldiers, we'll match them gun for gun if that's how they want it. they know me for what i am, tom-- and they're scared of me.
a water main broke.
stevie... i...
yes. i need to return to the observatory immediately. i must continue a critical experiment i was running on the amargosa star.
what do you want me to do?
the art will start when i play my part as the healer who will steal your heart
what for?
but i am...
will you let me talk to you, please?
and tell her what?
get back in the car!
have a look.  at nothing.
i may throw up.
really?  do you have a favorite piece?
nancy have any severe childhood illnesses? scarlet fever? high temperatures -- concussions?
god, i wish i could say the same thing.  what about having a nice, dull dinner with me tonight. scrabble, knock-knock jokes, anecdotes about famous dead italians....
one of these days he'll start on you, the way he did on her.  "you think life's beautiful, don't you, jessica?  you think you're beautiful, don't you, jessica?"  what he could do to that word "beautiful." that's paul's great weapon -- words.  he uses them the way other men use their fists.
then who's it for?
karl, what in the world are you doing here?
we'll have hamburgers on the plane. you ready?
but the next one is murder.  first the little step, then the longer step , and then the step you can never take back.  you could tell about mitchell.  you could tell about magruder--and the detective. it would hurt, but you could do it.  you could never tell about me.
well, sir, consider the possibilities. a:  ryan is alive.  we have to take him back to the beach.  knowing you, you don't let him carry my gear, even though he really should, and we all get killed, trying to keep him alive.
uh, alex, we've only know each other one day.
he left his white house phone number in his hotel room.
and the grass?
they can deal with this sort of thing.
there's a charming thought.
well -- goodbye then --
don't ever say that.
okay.
yes.
riots?  my people live in the world's most beautiful city, their king has the grandest palaces on earth.  why should they feel anything but pride and contentment?
the vatican is made of constant mysteries meant to be enjoyed, not explained.
ta.
so we end up with everybody but the two bosses, at our meet. we ain't sayin' we're the leaders, but we're leadin'.
and i thought i was weird.
our batting average isn't very good is it?  so far we're zero for two.
mom.
i know what you're like ..
if you get a new wife, i guess you'll have sex with her, huh?
sure.
where? where do you think a mustache would be. look!
"yeah, right"... well why not?  what's so wrong with me?
well, i think i_ve got a handle on the czech pysche and i reckon this kind of joint will make _em reminisce about the sixties. plus we should get a few stray expat_s looking for kafka.
i guess i'm the only one.
dammit!!!! dammit!!!!
i don't know.
you're kidding.
then you got undressed.
if it means getting silent night back, absolutely.
that's my job. i'll take care of that. i'll keep that stuff out of the papers - if you'll help me. but i can't do anything if you go around talking to people. will you promise me to be careful from now on?
well then, you've got the sword and you've got the armor; all's lacking is the steed.
i'm going.
you find out?
'that's my car, motherfucker.'
she's dead.
five times a day?
cook school -- that did it.
and suppose a little old lady lives there?
i wish they had.  he takes fifty dollars a week from my father's cash drawer.  but you can't kill a man like fanucci.
this is our last chance to play "what if". i want to do it. i'm just scared of getting caught.
he's god! i mean, this man is god! he's got millions of followers who would crawl all the way across the world just to touch the hem of his garment.
look at the size of it!
romance in ridgemont? we don't even get cable tv.
'cuz we don't need to draw any more shit down on our heads. we hit whoever's between us and israel. i don't want to dead the whole floor and i don't want to be killing women no matter how they make a living.
yes, it is.
does that bother you, bill?  i always wondered in court why it is because a woman is a prostitute, she has to have bad eyesight.
we find many viewers leave him on all night for comfort.  haven't you ever watched your child or your lover sleep?
anything.
my creator did not intend for me to experience these things.
at what, exactly?
mm.
i can't take him.
where -- ?
as long as it does exist, your mind won't ever be free. i think you should light the match, paul.
thanks.  god, i hope they're not screwed up.  i might have to bag the whole semester. anyway, sorry to bother you.
why?
i didn't start this, r.l.
no, i'm sorry, i can't do it. we- we've blown it already. i-you know, uh, i-i can't go in in the middle.
no fuckin' lie...
you can do it. you're the most powerful woman on earth.
oh, jesus -- nancy!  hey! we got a fire!
at...
take it off.
when did pretending to be bored become a sign of superiority?  are you mad at me for giving the cabin new haircuts or are you just still miserably pining for wichita's lightning rod?
it's unbelievable. the man never ages.
and some really fast cars.
hell no! the way my mom carries on about sex -- you even mention the word and she goes into cardiac arrest. you shoulda seen her face when i told her we were gonna stay up all night saturday, he added. always afraid something is going to happen.
jesus christ!  listen to yourself! i can't do it, grace.  i can't do it.
do you think you could answer that?
but of course.
where you think you are, boy? they probably never seen a olive in this country.
i take five hundred.
sir, yes it is, sir.
what?
ten pounds.
she's left.
yeah, like that...  but, anyway, nobody gets out of this alive.  even if we quit smoking and cut out red meat.  everybody dies.
that's great, thank you.
it appears to be a magnetically sealed.
well, they're not mine.
i know about how she was like. but we was different. i's the only person she talked to about it. how she's abused. terrible things, gill, just terrible...
i'm sure. thank you all the same.
you can't.  counter's at 10 minutes. you don't have time.
-- ten.
-- yes?
i don't think of us that way - ever.
it's about to be a broken face.
so if i needed a doctor, you could be it?
no.  what happened... no one expected it.
well, it's about goddamn time!  i have a note here, or two pieces of a note, that appears to be from the man who killed those people in atlanta and....
the word is "everything." now what time does my plane leave tuesday?
you feign ignorance?
they gone to the field...
state of mississippi wants this ditch cleared by sundown. you got that?!
whoa, thanks, man.  these are cool. they'll be collector's items.
oh, frederick!
mrs. strode, michael myers is here to kill his family.  and he won't stop until you are all destroyed.  i only thank god that i found you before he did.
writer, is he?
are the cars ready?

you father was seduced by the dark side of the force. he ceased to be anakin skywalker and became darth vader. when that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. so what i have told you was true... from a certain point of view.

you don't get rich as a cook, either, believe me. i got a girl going to college this fall. the wife had to go back to nursing to help pay for it.
do i have to pay juice?
--she was panicked, carl--every time i mentioned watergate, you could tell.
seen you together, that's all.
michael, it's not true.  please tell me.
now?
you mean spies and things like that?
certainly not. we are here only briefly, in fact, until this evening, when we fly to austin, texas to visit a friend of mine who is an agent for the cia.
whoever said the human race was logical?  now if you'll follow me, i'll introduce you to the institute's pride and joy.
why.
crabtree said it sounded like something james would be messed up in.
and did they really ever explain why hannibal lecter liked to eat people? don't think so. you see, it's scarier when there's no motive, sid.
jacob singer.

how do you do?  what can i get you, what're you drinking?

thanks.  so... do we talk about this... or what?
talby, can you read me?
i can remember everything.  that's my curse, young man.  it's the greatest curse that's ever been inflicted on the human race.  memory -  i was his oldest friend.  as far as i was concerned, he behaved like swine.  maybe i wasnt' his friend.  if i wasn't, he never had one.  maybe i was what nowadays you call a stooge -
i'11 be sure to mention that to him.

this isn't my room?
a two-penny mauritius -- issued in 1856. not so rare as the others -- $30,000 perhaps.
what about the company?
you broke her heart! you broke your mama's heart. you stole me! that's right. fuck it away. but it ain't ever goin' away, cause your mama -- she's like a hungry ghost baby, she won't go away, she won't leave ya alone.
i thought you quit school. last i heard you were on your way to a construction job or something down in brazil.
don't you?
weapons. misdemeanor one.
you won't be committing a crime. the man will cheat, you'll just be doing your job, that's all.
how do you know his name?
i'm working on it.
. . . and they call me a fucking nut.
what?  who?
if the key's on him, to get the key we'd have to . . .
oh great...yeah, having a great time, and you?
we'll take it! will it fit?

it's not apparent.
three cheers for our champion.
scream.
don't rush to judgement until all the facts are in.
give her a chance, will you?
like for you to look for the man.
it's a scene. memorize it.
no, it's humiliating and you've been doing it since i was a kid.  i don't like it.  stop.  you may not like having a daughter with problems.  but guess what?  i don't like having a father who's drunk all the time.  i'll eat in my room.
would.
his name was swifty?
no. come on.
you are forgiven. goodbye.
that's correct.
answer the phone.
when will my case be heard by the tribunal?
who are you?  the undertaker?
leaving what?
man, i must really be stoned.  thanks, buddy.
well, if the bugs have hatched, and they're not here... then where are they?
why don't you reset and run it again.  the pods check out ok.
and dillinger's instructions to divert them -- it's all there - look, even his home phone number, when he logged on.
it'll give you the different countries, how they came to be, what they are now, how america came to be, the governments, the languages... everything.
it's all yours.
under these circumstances we might refuse to sign.
i hadn't thought about it.
well, i guess i got it wrong, then. seems to me i heard about a guy just your age that got hit so hard in the guts it almost killed him.
you -- listen:  you said to me, `if not now, when...'
i knew it. 'cause we wouldn't have heard anything if it was him. he's real careful. fact is, he's anal.
exactly that. we can put you inside someone else's body for fifteen minutes.
damn...
too late, your kid worships me.  and your wife -- she's an animal.  even i can't keep up with her.
five seconds.
oh yes we have... are you alone, mr. gittes?
nigger, back off, you ain't beatin' shit. now what would you do.
i have friends.
i dunno.
well, you'll just have to make do with him .
nah.  fuck, you guys are right, i don't know what i'm doing.  i mean i'm acting like i've got it all together tonight.  but i know vicky is gonna ask me if i love her.  and i don't know what i'm gonna say.  so now it's like, maybe i'll just wimp out on the whole thing.
you're goin' outside with me.  if there's no cops around, we just split.  otherwise, you go with us.
you changed cabs? you're sure no one followed you?
but, majesty, this is just a frolic. it's a piece about love.
yes, you and the whole special needs class.
so if i asked you about art you could give me the skinny on every art book ever written...michelangelo? you know a lot about him i bet. life's work, criticisms, political aspirations. but you couldn't tell me what it smells like in the sistine chapel. you've never stood there and looked up at that beautiful ceiling. and if i asked you about women i'm sure you could give me a syllabus of your personal favorites, and maybe you've been laid a few times too. but you couldn't tell me how it feels to wake up next to a woman and be truly happy. if i asked you about war you could refer me to a bevy of fictional and non-fictional material, but you've never been in one. you've never held your best friend's head in your lap and watched him draw his last breath, looking to you for help. and if i asked you about love i'd get a sonnet, but you've never looked at a woman and been truly vulnerable. known that someone could kill you with a look. that someone could rescue you from grief. that god had put an angel on earth just for you. and you wouldn't know how it felt to be her angel. to have the love be there for her forever. through anything, through cancer. you wouldn't know about sleeping sitting up in a hospital room for two months holding her hand and not leaving because the doctors could see in your eyes that the term "visiting hours" didn't apply to you. and you wouldn't know about real loss, because that only occurs when you lose something you love more than yourself, and you've never dared to love anything that much. i look at you and i don't see an intelligent confident man, i don't see a peer, and i don't see my equal. i see a boy. nobody could possibly understand you, right will? yet you presume to know so much about me because of a painting you saw. you must know everything about me. you're an orphan, right?
and he's making a lot of noise about having his homies hang a colombian necktie on whoever it was.
but like, what do you like to do when you're not working?
no kidding... panda. where'd that come from?
"devil" frightened me as much as it excited me, but i'd be hard pressed to choose a favorite.
no short game.
anything about the convention in philadelphia?

yeah, well, i'm in l.a. now.
thirty-two outta what, twenty?
nepal? have you been?
any sign of lindenmeyer?
int. vitelli's helicopter - day.
a nix specialty?
i have to be simple again, swana, and you may find it shockingly banal. i've thought it over and i'm willing to take all the consequences, even if it means a complete readjustment of my way of living.
mind if i have a look?
gosh, this is really a great conversation--i can't believe i said that out loud.
well, we *must* see a lot of you, senator. come, father.
then you can go.
suit up.
just one person. isn't that so?  you know what this is all about, don't you? it has very little to do with whether you should play "cora" - it has everything to do with the fact that you've had another fight with bill.
about your being away all the time. must get lonely.
i'm a quick learner.
open it.
i think i would rather just turn them over.
i thought you may have gotten drunk and decided to come here to talk me out of quitting.
that's not true!
what do they want me to do?
gimme another explanation.
just do it, old man.
jesus christ, it's a clusterfuck.
what'd you say?
what?
fine. you get back to chatting with your precious customers.
maybe i just live here, what do you think about that?
it's going to be a tree, i think.
huh huh. you mean like this?
it's in a very pretty area that gets a lot of sun, has palm trees out front, mountains in the background...
get in.
don't judge a comic book by it's cover.

anyone know how to release the lines on this crate?
you want me to front for you.
i don't think so, but it don't really matter. they know i'm meeting you.
forgive me. it is not here. i assumed he had mind-melded with you. it is the vulcan way when the body's end is near.
i had to test you.
that's under lock and key.
we know you can get to us, and now you know we can get to you. i'm offering you the chance to call this off.
yes, my aunt. but perhaps she wept a little. tell me how you love her, will.
yes.
sorry. what you doing?
down.
that's not what i mean.  i've never done anything right.  i've been going around with my head in a sling for years...i don't want to drag you into this but i can't help it.  i don't think i can prove anything by going around pretending i'm tough any more, so maybe you look like one thing but you still feel like another.
so... what? so we should just make pretend over the phone that we're dating?
only in times of extreme stress.
he's lying, clyde.  always has. that's why nixon's always been useful. hold still.  and take your hand off your hip.
... to make sure craft service keeps those little butter cookies, and plenty of them-
i don't
i'll take you later.
no. you can't trust her.
maybe you're right. help me get something to carry her downstairs.
brynner.
peter, this is very nice, but you don't have to do any of this, you know.
but wait. you ain't seen nothin' yet.
not much.
how was it?
i'm ready.
it sure is hell jus' tryin' to get enough to eat.
no -
no. we just -
it means uncommon beauty is commonly overlooked. most people only notice birds with the brightest colors.
what did you do with her?
great, son -- not like wakin' up in jail. for a minute or two, didn't quite know where i was, but when i saw your face lookin down on me, made me know right away the day was gonna be a good one, and it all belonged to me!
you mean baron von gaigern?

an individual more like you, you mean.
i can and i am and i will - tomorrow! i gotta think about the little wharvey gals! they look to me for answers! vernon can s'port 'em and buy 'em lessons on the clarinet! the only good thing you ever did for the gals was get his by that train!
wha... ?
you're pathetic, man.  when's the last time you had some fun?  when's the last time you took a night off, had a date?
tired...
bob...
relax, dad.  it's daytona, not mongolia.
thank you, mr carter.  this is mr. leland.
your words sting more sharply than your whip.
no, thanks.
but why him?
go home!
anybody violates my turf -- our turf -- i'll rip out there heart and show it to 'em.
what's that?
i wanted to apologize.
will you take of f your blouse?
yes. tell me about the day you got off the train.
calls himself dodd.
i said "do not wear that outfit again." wear a dress. a skirt or something.
i'm a catholic, you know, and even to think about suicide is a terrible sin.
well, i mean... you know, i gotta ask you. that's a lot of money. you're not asking for a box of popcorn, you know. i mean...
gee, it's good to see you!
something witty and devastating like that.
that's where he's being clever. acting nonchalant.
how did you know gracie's pregnant? nobody knows that.
yeah, and in california you never have to buy fruit 'cause it's all on the trees everywhere you turn...  ...and, 'course there ain't no speed limit out there, and all drugs are legal... and i heard your first month's rent is free; state law. i figure 'til we get settled we can just move around month to month...
what about that?
i don't know.
you know what they say...the classics are eternal.
i can reach it. i can reach it...
you bet he did.
we had a chance...we could have stopped them!  the mob stole the trucks and smashed everything up.  the fools!  they cut their own throats!
you think so?
t-bird?
name one.
kali ma protects us now and for ever, and we must pledge our devotion by worshipping her with an offering of flesh and blood!
is that what you call it?
you don't understand...
he's already gone to bed.
dropped two big ones. real fighter. you're in the insurance line, harry?
who wouldn't.
no!
which is?
i guess i lied..you can't get both of us out of here, can you?
yes, it is.
you hearing me?
i know, but so is the enemy -- they're falling back -- paris is ours...!
there wasn't any way to explain it.
he took my driver's license, john, he knows where we live.
well, i forgive you this time. but i'll be in tomorrow night with a breathtaking blonde, and it will make me very happy if she loses. uh huh!
why were you sitting here, instead of...
absolutely. bank robbers are generally your smartest criminals.
he'll find us. we go talk to him.
twice.
you're a fool!
oh, i can imagine. p-p-probably the wife of an astronaut.
whacking?
excuse me, baas, but how long have you been in south africa?
scott, you can't save everyone.
is it also not true that you murdered his brother william in a misdirected crime of passion?
who said sidney?
the important thing is we both made it. that's something we have in common.
these? what are these? they're swords.
right. best cowboy that ever punched deck. the old man taught me most of what i know.
is she bringing him to the wedding?
you don't owe me anything. we're on the same team.
no. she died when i was eight. we couldn't find her for days. she went and crawled underneath our back porch...
i'm not like wes.  wes was crazy.
fuck...
huh?
according to the ancients, cat's are the guardians at the gates of the underworld. imhotep will fear them until he is fully regenerated, and then he will fear nothing.
i've got a room at the institute i use when i stay late.
i... no. you do this for money?
it used to make me laugh, but.
well, it's kinda a strange time right now. things are kinda -
multiply it by infinity and take it to the death of forever and you will still have barely a glimpse of what i am talking about.
and ...?
but you're always at the library.
fucking australians!  i hate that country, continent, what is it? don't we do nuclear testing there?
i just thought i'd drop by, scrounge a little lunch, i was in the neigh- borhood --
prepare for a change in lifestyle.
chris! tell me some good news.
you guys know her?!  i gotta have an intro!  man, i'd like to --
no. just that you need to hurt me with it. i've been where you've been.
he was like sucking my tits. he was fucking fingering me. but that shit was nice and hard.
after you cut her loose.
i rather hoped you'd be wearing it.
he served his time for what he did. another thing... if lula went with him of her own volition - willingly, that is - there ain't much can be done about it.
you're hurting.
what? oh, come on. you're not gonna suck my cock?
the marquis de sade and origins of sadism.
forget about childs.  he's over.
what are they doing to duncan? duncan!
well, it's sandstone. christian symbol. early latin text. mid-twelfth century, i should think.
well, then we agree a traditional closed adoption would be best for all involved, then?
and you know why it's so good? see, because, see, you guys are real. no, man, i mean it. you guys have a sense of humor. you live your lives, you know. it's simple, you know. the guys on the road, i mean, the band, all they talk about is scoring chicks... and danny, all danny talks about is money.
why aren't there any lights?
oh my gosh, here it is!
well, i don't know; maybe she does deserve it. maybe she should've come in to face you man to man.
i need a new pr guy.
he's never going to come back. he's gone off to be a soldier and mummy doesn't even know.
why'd you come out here?
no, not tonight. i'm in bed too. i'm calling because i need you to listen. you're supposed to be a smart guy. you're a professor. i got this theory. jack says he didn't see twombley shot but he did.
uh unh, carrying a gun wrecks the line of a fine jacket.
why lie about everything else, then?
naw, hell, let them stay here with me and do men things. there might be some kind of ball game on we can watch. you go on.
it may not be last week again for a long long time.
yeah, okay.  okay.
ok, well... i love you.
don't you want to watch it?
twenty-four isn't young.  i'd already been goin' out with him ten years when we got married.  i've never been with anybody but darryl.
reverend mother, on behalf of the sisters, i'd like to welcome mary clarence to st. katherine's.
wilmont. near the high school.
why not let your publisher judge that?
the brewers.
what about her arms?
real, my ass. it's an overblown game.  anybody ever catch that fucking psycho?
you don't go through all the hardships of an ocean voyage to make "friends".
macleod!
exactly.
ben says he and elaine are getting married.
okay.
hey, do i know you?
why do i feel i needn’t answer that?
yeah. so how do i get to venice?
not very well, i'm sure.  i'd probably start doping myself.  or maybe i'd...
my complication had a complication, but dr chapman says i'll soon be up and bouncing about like a young gazelle. are you buying a christmas present for your mother?
no! we'd be the first living men to set foot in the halls of the gods.
it is, isn't it? you make millions of decisions that mean nothing and then one day you decide to order takeout and it changes your life.
i'm sorry, i've never seen any of them.
sorry, alan it's been six years.
oh, there are so many.
native costume?
you're the disturbance, pal! and here...  i'm buying some... what's this?... chewlie's gum. there. i'm no longer loitering. i'm a customer, a customer engaged in a discussion with other customers.
jamie?  but i thought she was --
your cell is more than adequate.
and shut up.
you're kidding me.
what whistle?  there's no fucking whistle.  this is fucking dangerous.
decloak the holo-ship and engage a tractor beam, mister worf.
ah, so what?
when you found me yesterday, at the pool. i'd seen... something.  someone.
page 87 of what, harry?
not yet.
guess! guess, majesty. imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it.
wanna get on somebody 'bout live music, get on ol' laz, there. he the one got this place shakin' back in the day.
in some situations.
maybe you should give it some time.
i guess that's for the best.
he's parted his moorings.
no, but i've confirmed the reelection rally is the target.  how much c-4 is missing?
this would be it?
that's the first time i ever saw him kiss a man, like a dad, wasn't that just... thrilling?  i mean, he must have been needing that.
it's the future, isn't it? just like you told scrimm.  i knew you weren't from around here.
like how?
yeah.
that's funny, you're cute.
people! come on. "parade" float.
you do it!
least you can do.
i don't have a clue.
yeah.
then maybe i should offer it to your daughter...
what?
atta, boy!
wow, this is the coolest thing, like you really eat and sleep here?
no, father. from now on no one will be able to speak of mozart without thinking of me. whenever they say mozart with love, they'll have to say salieri with loathing. and that's my immortality - at last! our names will  be tied together for eternity - his in fame and mine in infamy. at least it's better than the total oblivion he'd planned for me, your merciful god!
that i really don't know.
so i've been told.
i do renounce him.
there you go.
i'll be going, too, to help out. it should be fun, melanie.
i am a scientist...!  not a philosopher.
i'm not gonna let it go. the man needs to explain himself. makin' promises.
no i didn't.
yeah.  i'm sorry... look dick, laura and i broke up.  she's gone.  and if we ever see barry again maybe you can tell him that.
and when they shot me father...
he's the one.  he's been the one all along.  stalking us.
i don't think i know that one.
<u>what</u>?...
right now?
what about the cromwells?
what's she like? what's she like?...
do you have great devotion for the virgin?
a detective.  he falls for the wrong girl.
do you mind?
standard vig.  minus five for a certain blabber-mouth moron by the name of jimmy the finn, who's living proof that natural selection is a flawed theory.
no.  no.  he didn't mean anything by it at <u>all</u>...
patriotism is its own reward.
we... uh, have been unable to come up with any information before the man appeared at mr. rand's home ... and, uh...
head for the roof!
will you be ok now? i've got to go to your place to see if he's still there. i've got to see if it's... if it's what we both think it is.
there's nothing to be sorry about.
i know she's sorry she won't be seeing you anymore. anyway, she wanted me to take care of you.
i don't know.  few days.  thanks for helping me.  i appreciate it.
how good is he?
johana... new york.
now, i know that i shall die if you leave me.
do you ever get sick of it?
savagery is what monkeys understand.
negative. it's impacting on all our systems!
what is it?
and to say you're sorry.  about this afternoon.  and the things you said. forgotten.  completely.  do you understand?  forgotten.
huh.  and why is that?
and how's life with the walking h-bomb?
their life expectancy is a hundred and thirty.
if that were so, you'd be dead now. he was aiming at the dark one, for there is ancient hatred between them. once his race had two eyes, like other men, until his forefathers bargained with the dark ones: they gave up one of their eyes in return for the power to see the future. but they were cheated, for the only future they were permitted to see was the time of their own death.
i'll be glad to see you pa. last time i seen him was at a baptizin', an' he had one a the bigges' doses of the holy sperit i ever seen. he go to jumpin' over bushes, howlin' like a dog-wolf in moon-time. fin'ly he picks hisself out a bush big as a piana an' he let out a squawk an' took a run at that bush. well, sir, he cleared her but he bust his leg snap in two. they was a travellin' dentist there and he set her, an' i give her a prayin' over, but they wasn't no more holy sperit in your pa after that.
in the yellow ribbon.
my car's in the garage.
don't quote rules, harry! we're talking about loyalty. and sacrifice. one man who died for us, another who has deep emotional damage --
so, let me get this straight. you came over to our house late last night and he forced intercourse on you.
right. and how did she dress him?
you better put on the lights. i can't see what i'm doing.
yes!  with a herring!  with a herring!  cut down with a herring!
you look good, jeffrey. did you have a nice flight?
yes, one of many.
can you use a few bucks? i ain't got much, but --
okay... let's say that, for now.
you may not believe this... but there's a part of me that wants more than anything to believe in your god.  to believe that we're all here for a purpose, that all this... means something.  but it's because that part of me wants it so badly that i'm so stubborn about making sure it isn't just self-delusion. of course i want to know god if there is one... but it has to be real.  unless i have proof how can i be sure?
you've been a good friend, james carter.
what do you want?
keep away from me!  i don't believe you anymore!
i just could never say it!
morning painless. how they goin'?
frank? .can you stand up?
you already have.  now go on.  do it.
is that what i think it is?
happy anniversary.  you're a good match, you two.  can you help me with this stuff?
that doesn't sound so bad, come on, we'll never find that streamer.
i can't. the chat room isn't open for another five days.
we got us a tent, forty-two feet across, eighteen feet at center, hundred-and-ten foldin' chairs. circuit's eleven towns, covers all 'a hasset county and most 'a weller county.  i expect that upon completion of my military service i will be joinin' said ministry.
nothing! i simply existed. so what was the answer? a jealous woman, right? a clinging possessive mother.  wrong. with all due respect to oedipus, i don't think that was the case at all.
i wanted to, jeff.  oh!
diz--
no... we're trying to save heller.
no.  it's not just how i felt toward jessica.  i've been cruel to even you.
well, quick -- get into bed.  are you all right?
he's not gonna stop, satch.  he's gonna keep on...
at this point, the most likely result of a foreign pact is war.
you don't show for chicago, everyone'll know there's something going on.
our abstinence makes our love immortal.  if i loved you a quarter of an hour ago, now i should love you even more.  but i should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires.
mulder. move away from the door. we're coming through it.
and you could care less --
no water.
i'm not gonna help you kill this guy, if that's what -
i got two problems.  number one, i'm not playin' games.  number two, you got nothin' to bet with.
i know, but that's not the way things happened...
where's my gun?
not at all, if it can help.
thank you, bob. the electricity is everywhere tonight. rocky balboa, a fifty-to-one underdog, is living a cinderella story which has captured peoples' imaginations all over the world -- to quote a popular sports magazine, 'the fighting style should be 'the caveman against the cavalier.' from the increase in sound it appears the challenger is now approaching the ring... his record is forty-four wins, twenty losses and thirty-eight knockouts.
finsbury park. we’re in finsbury park.
pleading with a crazy man, with come all over my face.
you're right, mr. bernstein.
and if future man doesn't get let out of jail in 48 hours, then we go back. all right?
no more thoughts from your asses.  or i will burn your asses and snort the ashes. hear me?
i took yours from you.  your little girlfriend?  i took hers, too.  your meaningless, petty life?  i took it so that tonight your existence might gain a purpose.  you're no avenger. you're mine.
yeah, sure. of course.
did you want one?
maybe one day -- after you've been married twenty years you'll understand.
i'm sorry.  what are you doing up here?
yes.
he was killed last night. by birds.
i said where?  where'd you go?!
the police?  we'd never live to testify. not against spats colombo.  wabash 1098.
can you use these?
cowan-- will you shut your god damed mouth?
how the hell did you do that?
okay.
well, i know, more so. that's why i was thinking... maybe she'd be better off.
it's three years old, it --
john...
how could you?! this is just like home!
and i'm not covering for you when you sneak out to call dominos.
it's, uh... it's in reference to that gentleman and my wife. the more i think about it the more irritated i get.
then you yield to me.
i like to wear women's clothes: panties, brassieres, sweaters, pumps... it's just something i do. and i can't believe i'm telling you, but i really like you, and i don't want it getting in the way down the road.
i think i'm we got that eighty-eight.
what if you don't?  then i'm fucked. you see...?  then it's my job. that's what i'm telling you.
wanna kiss me, jim?
why, my head would just squash like an eggplant, mcmurphy.
take it off! take it off!  ...s'il vous plait?...
epps, over.
ok.  ok.
fella named beaumont. they have him up at county. it started out drunk driving, but they wrote it up "possession of a concealed weapon." dumb monkey-ass had a pistol on him.
i suppose you gotta get up early, huh?
i could have it all! holy cats! all the oil! all the tankers! all the pumps! the gosh-darn world will be out to lunch! no heat, no gas--sis, this is some nifty idea!
why are you saying it?
this is his state. his uncle's chief judge. his brother-in-law runs the county commission. i don't know how many other relatives he's got in town.  there's gotta be a way to work him back in.
if you don't want to go with me just say so. say 'kenny, i don't want to make love to you' but don't use your dad as an excuse. i'm so sick of it.
popcorn.
but he's zeroing in on <i>me</i>.  on <i>us</i>. everyone's talking about it.
no.
it was.  i think it's pretty much ready for the --
you want me to bring the vcr over here so we can watch this?
okay, i'm going, i'm going. jesus...
get your hat, senator. we've got a lot to do between now and tomorrow--
i feel much better. thank you.
yes, general formica.  carry on, my good man!  i don't know what we would do without you.
please.
didn't you, baby?
tonight let's not represent anybody but ourselves.
so how much for our first tour.  two no-shows and one sick triceratops.
i'd say i'd get you one but the guy who made it, he's probably dead, i don't know.
yea?
i never thought of that.
i'll drink some more of stoltzfus' tea.
...you're such a puzzle.  so sweet with me and so...contemptuous of everyone else. 
don't feel so concerned, jerry.
print this frank.
i sent a lot of checks, i'm not sure what all of them are.
i dunno, probably right up there, based on her resume.
i got it.  and i took pictures of the new church for you, too.
yes.
stop him, jessica!
me, too...
jack.
you boost her -- ?
are you in the service?
light in those passages ain't so good.
duly noted, ted.  edmunds, try using suction.
oh don't worry kid, i know where you live.  now i want you to go upstairs and write this down, buy yahoo. you got that space cowboy.  y-a-h-o-o. it's a magic word and i never want you to forget it.
did you have sex with her?
mhravitch.
it's not what you owe <u>me.</u> time is so fleeting.  one day it's gone.  you make it out of this alive, max, you really should call her.  that's what i think.
oh, no, i wanted to go along with you.
he doesn't even look like that.
c'mon, snake - it's l.a. everything's phony, you know that.
yes.
ooh.
so... spontaneous.  all that leaping off buildings and chinese fighting and whatnot.
why not?
as does your ability, horatio.  we must talk further, when it's more convenient.
she sacrificed herself..
not her. you!
he's tanking on us...
for a long time, the f.b.i.'s been hooked into the library system, keeping accurate records.
awww, it's just been a shitass day. every inch of it hot and miserable. first off, nadine at the blue chip got some sorta sick, so that mongoloid boy of hers was workin' the grill. that fuckin' idiot don't know rat shit from rice krispies. i ate breakfast at nine, was pukin' up pigs in a blanket like a sick dog by ten thirty.
oh, would you stop lying mother!
hun -- this is anna.  anna -- this is honey -- she's my baby sitter.
was he there often?
your brothers are right.  it was the most god-awful smell i've ever had my nose around.
then why is there fear behind your eyes?
depth-finder, fathometer, sonar, closed-circuit tv -- fore and aft -- rdf, single side band...  and two loose nuts behind the wheel.
there's a call i want you to make with me, charles.
sure... tonight. then please stay at my place.
there's gonna be some left over for you, buddy. i take care of my boys.
a nap?
bullshit! she was alive when we left her with you.
i thought this was a 45-minute seminar.
uh huh...
you didn't tell me about red deer table --
and hu li killed him for the plates.
tell me, and then you can sleep.
i deserve better than this.
we're not upset with you, dave.  we think you did a terrific job.  don't we?
see you over there, miles.
hello, morton.
spare your energy.  i'll be back!
what would you like?
what?
go straight up about another mile... til we hit cherrypicker road and turn right... it ain't far from there.
uh huh.
impotent.
you are my son.  don't you see the opportunity that lies before you?
it's natural.  a reaction to their presence, to the... unnaturalness of it.  it's part of how you are able to track them.
i've told you a hundred times not to speak to me with a cigarette in your mouth.
or maybe it's jeanne who's in a trap -- her own trap -- a downward spiral that she can't stop?
oh, of course.  which of these instruments do you play?
a monument to a man who thought that what the world needed most was more rhinoceros meat.
oh, but they can!
i'd give you a very good price.
let me think. i need time to think.
you just drove a fucking customer away, barry.
i knew you would.
did he ever marry the girl? did he ever go exploring?
i think this would be a marvelous opportunity for you, roger.  up to now, you've always been associated with musicals, and...
if we're not here for each other during the tough time, we're not a news organization.
she isn't that old.
why what?
yeah, they're full of great ideas.
no, of course not.
oh, what? you're going to take the professor's side on this?
i want to stop taking those pills.
he's fine. okay mikey, let's go.  you guys stay here.
hello miles.
frieda's boss.
ram it in and break it off!
war games? thailand? that's not true! how can you believe that? can't you see what they're doing? it's all a lie. we were in da nang, for god's sake. you've got to believe me.
clearly.
it wouldn't be half so much fun for me. toddy, as to have you come here and beg --
because he was a <u>real</u> hero, chucky. he was acting out of a deep instinctive decency, not out of some ego thing.  he didn't expect the media to lionize him.  he didn't expect a million dollar reward. he saved fifty-four people because something inside him, some fundamental love for his fellow man, made him rush into that plane when "good sense" told him otherwise. he was willing to settle for some credit cards he sold to laplante....  for how much, laplante?  a couple of bucks?  did you give him enough for a decent meal?
good. is there anything you need -- money -- ?
sid 6.7 told me after he killed the two guards. he suggested i kill you rather than him.
i'm really lost.  what does this have to do with walking?
mr. malkovich?
and don't forget. i have the key.
china will think it happened before midnight. britain will swear it happened after midnight...
why me?
oh no. it is a sublime piece. the grandest operone. i tell you, you are the greatest composer known to me.
i believe it was because of another letter i'd written to goebbels lamenting the decline of musical standards due to racial policies.
i can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
sure, three experts and not one of them could do it!  they're telling us oswald got off three shots with world-class precision from a manual bolt action rifle in less than six seconds - and accordin' to his marine buddies he got maggie's drawers - he wasn't any good.  average man would be lucky to get two shots off, and i tell ya the first shot would always be the best.  here, the third shot's perfect.  don't make sense.  and then they got that crazy bullet zigzagging all over the place so it hits kennedy and connally seven times. one "pristine" bullet?  that dog don't hunt.
shut up, it is. i told dennis if he gave me another topic that was political, i'd spew burrito chunks.
jesus -- why?
a dirtbag behind the counter holding a sawed-off. a berretta nine millimeter in his belt. a female hostage, red dress, on the floor in front of the cereal display. male hostage, jeans and blue checked shirt, three feet to her right. another male hostage, white pants, green shirt, nikes, laying in front of the magazine rack. a female dirtbag with a gun under her shirt, sitting against the beer cooler, trying to pass herself off as a hostage, and there's a special on toilet-paper, four for a buck twenty-nine.
i'm not gay.
get back here, rool!
what department?
i said, someone came last night --  look, this isn't a carnival -- people call and they make an appointment and they follow the rules -- everyone signs in and out -- this is a serious place -- serious work -- it's not just to come in whenever you like --
you go in her room, take the lilacs from the water, dry them.  go buy some cellophane, wrap em up, and get a card from <u>marty</u>.  what's her problem?
and when is she due back from that groinecologist's convention anyway?
fuck your hot chocolate, rudy.
i have to be somewhere.
there was blood everywhere, rosa. i saw it, i think i watched the whole thing happen... oh my god...
burke, just tell me one thing. that you're going out there to kill them.  not study.  not bring back.  just burn them out...clean ...forever.
...your <u>scar</u>..?
you a virgin? -- ya let 'im in ya pants, didn't ya!  ya pulled down ya pants an' let him have it, didn't ya!!
what do you mean?
thanks.
so kenton connected the... lesion, <u>and</u> whatever suspicions he had about your personal life... to this woman, maria... and blew the whistle on you. suddenly you're losing files, and it's time to let you go. but, up to this point, you've been their golden boy, their rising star... their behavior is... inconsistent.
ha! i said "doll-hairs." psych! but a deal's a deal, my friend. in you go.
yes -- he did.
is she?
well, not too, i mean, a little.
you all been here a long time. doesn't anybody ever escape from this place?
dave, just calm down.  meet me in the lobby of the fontainbleau in 20 minutes.  i'll have a suite reserved for you under an assumed name.
fine thing jim taylor wished on me-- show him the monuments--i need this job like i need ten pounds.
how?
you better believe everybody's trying to sign him up.
good god. let's go rescue him.
on the street where you live.
he talks loud. and he loves his code.
as it was in the begin is now and ever shall be, world without end, amen.
he programmed you to tell us just what he wanted you to. customs has been
that woman's laugh creeps me out. i heard somethin' like that... somewhere before... sound'd like the wicked witch...
stick to my heels.
okay, i get your father, i get your mother and i get your brother, but what are you doing here?
abort? reed, i put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and i will not let you make me look like a fool --
i must find the means to save him, then. i was hoping i could ask you for a little magic help, but if it makes you so tired...
i thought you might paste them into your book.
crane. ed crane.
oh, my god, look at her!
try joshua strader, will ya, darlin'?
in mexico law enforcement is an entrepreneurial activity, this is not so true for the usa.  using regression analysis we made a study of the customs lanes at the border and calculated the odds of a search.  the odds are not high, and we found variables that reduce the odds.  we hire drivers with nothing to lose.  then we throw a lot of product at the problem.  some get stopped.  enough get through.  it's not difficult.
i don't think the producer has to do much, outside of maybe knowing a writer.
...it's a teaser!
that building?
ohio...
that's for sure.
we're on the move. let's go. as they walk toward a corridor.
umm...
vegas!
you professional men drive a hard bargain. i'm afraid i only have five on me. sheila pulls out a 5 dollar bill.
that's better.  got the radar ready?
i certainly was not!
you, sir! you call yourself a loyal subject?
what do you mean, too bad?
well, that's you see, what i am, kind and feeling.
it's okay.
haven't got one.
have to pump her steady, s'all.
don't remember that being my fault. seems like you divorced me same time as your mom.
spare me the race card, oj.  we're not going out into the sun.  it's too risky.
but how?
look, i don't have time for you, get out of my way!!
baryonyx?
jesus, soap, stop being such a mincer. i thought about that and...
i suspected, but you were the one low contacted. that's why i brought you back here.
sure.
jesus! the barber! i'll be a sonofagun. why didn't you say so? 'course--the barber.
yes, that'd be nice.
seed alone won't do, mary. we have to throw the calf in.
i promise --
the locks.
-- barry, if i were to say to you i haven't seen evil dead ii yet, what would that mean?
yes, but we know who it was, and i will tell you, agent starling, what you know to be true.  i offered the bounty.  it was illegal, and, worse, it was <u>wrong</u>. and i thank god every day that i did not compound my sinful life by the stain of a murder.  do you  agent starling:  do you know <u>god</u>? 
everybody makes their own fun.  f'you don't make it yourself, it ain't fun, it's entertainment.
excuse me!  mark it zero.  next frame.
i'm -- i'm afraid i have no money.
we're ready when you are.
dancin' on razor blades here...
or the bijou.  either one.
in great pain?
good.  i want around-the-clock surveillance on that house.
bond!
the criminal courts building.
then it happened before they scuttled her.
comrade! comrade! otchi tchorniya -- otchi tchorniya!
then he will die!
i like rock and roll. no...i guess that's too mild. i love it. since my ears started to die out on me, it's the only music i can really hear. and since my wife died...i dunno, some- times a little rock and roll fills up night. not always, but sometimes.  one more time--welcome to ludlow. hope your time here will be a happy one.
exactly! i thought a gentleman was somebody who owned horses. turns out, the short and very simple definition of a gentleman or a lady is: someone who always attempts to make the people around him or her feel as comfortable as possible. that's it! if you don't do that, nothing else matters. the cars, the clothes, the houses...
see you later.  good luck.
for how long?
do you know tom?
okay fine. let's get this over with.
get the car!
your mom.
not much, admiral. we have partial main power...
you feel like you want to be forgiven for your sins?  honey, you're not on your death bed, yet....this kinda talk's gonna get you in trouble --
no, i left everything in paris. i just happened to be wearing this.
not good enough.
delighted, sir.
down, daphne!
what?
what will he pay?
uh, yes, sir.  the monroe hotel...
sir, this is not a lending library, it's the hall of records.
holding my own.  you know that guy who was calling me all the time?  he's started again.  he's been putting stuff in my mail.
uh huh.
me?
we're worried about you. "60 minutes" was on same-sex couples.
i've got him.  the guy in the turban.
hello, venkman.
no, no james, it's not like that.  tony and china, they're just friends.
hey, what more could i want? i survived my first and last hallucinogenic hellride, and neither of us is dead. i'd say i feel almost as great as you look.
i'm not a lawman, i'm just a private citizen getting' my property back
who's got the ammo?
not at all.
kind of impatient for a big-time headshrinker, aren't you? how 'bout you let me explain it my own way...
no.
my aunt bella, sweet woman not the brightest bat in the world - she used to hang right side up, anyway she always said "curses were made to be broken". course, she said it in those irritating little bat squeaks, so it wasn't quite so profound...
the pimp-mobile?  just made a few after market modifications.  nitrous-oxide injection system, forged aluminum pistons and crankshaft, higher flowing fuel pump.
i'm not going anywhere.
so they caught up with you, too?
it's serious?
i drink.  after hours of course.  on duty, i smoke.  do you mind?
i don't want to hear your problems, jackson. you'll get new men any day. time being you make do like everybody else.
it's in your closet.
bad games, bad towns, bad pay, bad flights, bad hotels, real bad food. homeless, rootless, lonely, maybe your copy gets into one issue out of four...
that's right, you have the right to remain silent.
watch and see.
i'm glad bill's back.
that's what the witnesses told him.
they say, also, that you have recreated the horrible monster who, for so many years, has haunted and terrorized the god-fearing people of this village.  what say you to that?
no, you'd keep me for yourself. four years fuckin' punks in the ass made you appreciate prime rib when you get it.
some other time, cecile.
my name isn't damon bradley.  i just told you it was damon bradley.
the one you gave me in the metro.
sure!  excuse me.
there's nothing i'm hiding. it's just that --
the blue.
sure thing, and --
looks like you need a haircut to me.
and the party?
where did paul hang out?
she ain't crazy. she love those children. she was trying to outhurt the hurter's all.
ah, sorenara mazu mazu nagaiki wo sareru to mira.  ah... then i am sure that you will have a long and happy life.
no, you...didn't?
yes?
very bad today.
dr. nebbleman, i want to know the moment the nanobot arrives.  the instant, understand?
-- please, get away from me.
"o, no, it is an ever-fixed mark that looks on tempests and is never shaken; it is the star to every wandering bark whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken."
i saw you fight kid gavilan.  i like your style.
then say it.
ray!  will you tell these guys to move back?
been there, done that, got the t-shirt.
or a husband.  depending on which of us you asked.  my friend david. he lived here for many years.
i'm here.
i've got be here for the police when they come.  then i've got to practise. in case you forgot i'm in the middle of a match right now.
the job is worth about two million euros. pull this off and you and your crew could make some real money, daniel. you leave tomorrow.
because i called up tommy's brother joe, and i said, "joe, she's driving me crazy. why don't you take her for a couple of years?" and he said, "oh no!" i know i sound like a terrible woman...
right. i hear they can be kind of a time-suck.
kane?  charlie?  where is he?
i didn't come here to get my palms read. i need something translated.
i'm sure i could have.
yes, if you like.  call me at work.
didn't i tell you?  i'm always right, you know, my dear... aren't i?
so here we are!
but where's the damage?
you did.
everywhere. fuckin' flophouse. we're still short on the rent. if you want, you and casper can move in. you guys can share the bathtub.
this is going to drive the ante up.
rain.
creasy. pinta likes him.
uh,  yeah.  we're old friend*
a few years older, perhaps.
gordon would not have sent us to deer meadow without thinking it was a high priority situation.
who's your partner?
just once, if they take your plane away.
chip! you know how much i hate the brown word!
...asshole.
activating power beam!
what are you afraid of?  i'm the one's got the gun.  stay here.
you don't hardly get settled till you're frettin' to git home again.
right.  let's put the water and provisions in the wagon.
damn it, jim, what the hell's the matter? other people have birthdays. why're we treating yours like a funeral?
under the circumstances, you may call me mrs. peel.
yes, madame!
whattya mean?
i'm serious, all right. you've got to square it with auggie. since you won't give the money back to the creeper, you can use it to make things right with auggie. that's probably better anyway. better to keep your friends than to worry about your enemies.
that's okay...
i see. so playing hockey and attending wakes-these practices are standard operating procedure.
i want to fly jets, sir!
oh yesil...  yesil's his name but i...don't know anything... 'bout...yesil...
why are you doing this to me, dave. why are you talking this way to me? i don't understand.  why are you doing this at all...?
you don't have to explain. you have every right to come.
who?
thank you.. .goodnight.
ours!
einstein. had two marriages, both train-wrecks. the guy never saw his kids, one of whom, i think, ended up in an asylum--
i can only tell you what he told us...
i'm sure.  if i were you, i would use this time, to think about my life.  and its direction.  or lack thereof.
is that what you did?
coz this is a major & we're closer to this bastard than anyone's ever been.
i know a lot of men who didn't do anything till they met walter burns. please, dear.
we'll worry about that when we get there.
the pentagon, wasn't it, general? only you weren't in that uniform...
oh yeah, i forgot.
someone needs to grow up.  i won't take it, jack.
i don't know you.
on the left.
all poetry was acceptable.  the name simply referred to the fact, that to join the organization, you had to be dead.
i'm not studying no mayor.  besides, he reminds me of my least favorite peoples.  my tenants and my ex- husband--goddamn-bless his soul.
no. i want my money back right now.
christ, you know it's crazy...  i lived through so many other people's nightmares, you know. always cool and calm, but... but i never thought i'd be the one needing help, ya know?
and have you noticed how your boobs have started to firm up?
ms. sutton hired you to find the girl.  period.
for being a bastard with no manners and not a dook of an idea how to comport yourself publicwise, o my brother.
and how did you feel when you ate this guy?
oh, no you don't. harry, now, not my best haviland.
cuba.
if you keep going straight you can get back on the interstate... it's easier.
why do you watch?
i wouldn't know what to do with it if i did.
i am told so.
do you know the <u>seller</u>?
well, i kind of hate to point it out, but all our supplies are based on us spending a strictly limited amount of time out of suspended animation... and as you know, we used up most of that time in harvesting.
better get out the hefty bags... looks like our boy desperately wants us to believe his story.
i'll do you for that.
what?
what if we get separated?  way i see it if something happens i want to be carrying my share.
you don't have to feel any way about it. lecter did it to amuse himself. why not, what can they do? take away his books for awhile, and no jello...  i know it got ugly today. but this is your report, starling - take it as far as you can. on your own time, outside of class. now carry on.
she'll drop you.  when she's done with you, she'll drop you.
where are you going?
what help can we possibly find in the cemetery at this time of night?
how do you do?
well we certainly know that's true.
those bastards at universal.  i made so much money for them, and now i can't get the time of day.
we're getting there. because in his so-called construction job, tommy makes a daily delivery to a place called "the hole."
get it, please.
i doubt it's my mind that interests her. i tell you prof, she's a fiery lady.
me neither. but i believe in knowing your enemy.
he must have been.  he was on the list of prisoners to be executed.
no. no man. that's... that's... you don't know what you're talking about. that's bullshit. i know these guys. i mean, thanks for your concern, but that just ain't the thing of it.
ah, your journal. this will be invaluable.
we get to peek into doucet's brain.
i gotta talk to me partner first. we can't afford to expose our game too much.
y-y-yeah, just for fifteen years.
i don't know you...
but i'm not a hero. i'm nobody's heroine..i'm nothing. you've said so yourself many times.
no. no. it's okay. i'm okay.
what's that pounding?
are you serious?
yeah?  is that an embarrassing question?  should i have not asked it?
yeah, i'm sure.
i wanted to congratulate you for the job you did on mr. lounds. i admired it enormously. what a cunning boy you are, will.
your dad dated my mom after her divorce.
then what the hell are you all about?
that leaves two strangers.
something made this happen, billy. mr. stephens is going to find out what it was.
they're agency, too.  don't you get it?  cia and mafia together.  trying to whack out the beard.  mutual interests.  they been doing it for years.  there's more to this than you dream.  fbi fucking hates the cia.  navy intelligence got something to do with it too.  check out "alan pope" in miami.  jack youngblood. bill harvey.  colonel roselli.  the shooter, i hear, was a dallas cop - the bagman at ruby's club.  i heard he shot his own partner.  got that? check out the rich fucks in dallas. h.l. hunt.  he's dirty.  that's all i know.  but the agency always runs the show.  check out something called "mongoose"  operation mongoose. government, pentagon stuff, they're in charge, but who the fuck pulls whose chain who the fuck knows, fun 'n' games man - check out southeast asia - that's the next big number - the heroin trail.  "oh, what a deadly web we weave when we practice to deceive."
include me in that.
thanks, i do understand. i was worried about how that would be... but now i'm not. and you should know that included with the rent here is a complimentary blow job.
i'm sorry, the party you're trying to reach is not answering. is there anyone else you would like to talk to?
i object to that form of question. note that.
you expect me to buy this?
and who the hell is that?
the tape was made a year ago. i can only assume they've reached phase two by now --
then philippe will have to kill all of you.
the voice man!  he's here!
yeah, me too.
i'm doing great.  you ready?
i don't know what he was, but he made frankenstein look like a lily!
oh, it's the bit of a girl fettes was talking about.
well shut it off at once!
...it looked money.
could you give us a moment.
graduation?
thanks.  i suppose all this comes under the heading of adventure.
he's very interesting. for all his pretending to be a tough guy, he's really got the soul of a poet.
i don't like to give up.
stand still.
that!
i'm here.
do you see?
our room. i don't want to see him and he's not going to come knocking on your door.
i need to make some calls. could i use... your office?
nice place.  fulla velvet.  even the bedspreads.  damn!  two-fifty a pack and i go through 'em like toothpicks. twelve-and-a-half cents a piece, you believe that?
that is why i believe in the future of my country.
i don't even know why you're still concerned over him.  daddy's not with you.
perhaps i was never meant to live with a woman...
let go! we've got to stop!
yes.
hmm-mmm.
you know, i really should take your card.
brad. i don't want to have to use sex as a tool.
it's two-point-five, george.  i am sure.
speak.
no, i was happy, but i just didn't realize i was happy.
none of them had any --
twenty eight years ago.
i know. i know.  i never promised myself a rose garden.
you should get back together with victoria. she was good for you.
it's all hollow. nothing behind it.
i'll be all right. you just do as i say.
a black man gave me the message.
do you think alexander has any chance to succeed as a mediator?
mrs. silvera.
when i saw you were gone i got scared.
who?
can you do it with your left hand?
no.
a dragon.
i think i'll stick around. i'll leave with the porters on their next trip.
no tell me. _ 84.
you're almost one of us now, michael.
john,we're going huntin'.
says who?
maybe he's just a <u>patriot</u>.
he'll say that?
well, who's sadie?
no jokes.  james is in love.
don't expect me to tell you who i am.
mr. president, the probe has passed through all quadrants. the starships shepard and yorktown and three smaller vessels have been neutralized.
thanks.
you're no good
yes, you are. and you must wake.
we are.
good luck..
yes, i do.  in fact, my firm has box seats for the mariners. why don't we all go next week?
i know.  the feeling just vanished.
did you see her undressed?
but suppose it doesn't?
anybody would have done it.
stop.
i'd rather get a whipping than have another talk with her.  anything but a talk with her.
yeah. okay. listen carefully ...  you're in the bathroom.  you've been shot in the shoulder ...
i drilled the bolts and went in through the window. it was the only way to bypass the smart glass.
he's out in his shed showing your uncle his new riding mower.
baby?  right on time.
yes. and believe me, of all the other mothers i would never dream of asking you, given the predicament with your son. but none of the other mothers are able to go.
you forgot her degree in literature. she's a writer.  she published a novel last year under a pen name. do you want to know what it's about?
hey! who needs physics when we've got chemistry?
good. my heart can't take it.
shut up!  where's that other miyatea?
what?
once a musketeer, always a musketeer, eh?
how 'bout we check with eve first?
that's just exactly what he has been doing. this deal should have been closed weeks ago. tell him to keep tomorrow open . . .
i get it now. you and me. we're dead.
i am. and that's why you should feel like a pig. you men make me sick. you'll sleep with anything that says yes.
good idea.
gimme the keys to get outta here!
we ain't one-at-a-timin' here, we mass communicatin'!
you can't come in.
now that you mention it, they might have been a little bit jumpy.
do i? i saw an iceberg once. they were hauling it down to texas for drinking water, only they didn't count on an elephant being frozen inside. the woolly kind. a mammoth.
took the words right out of my mouth. go on... i'll be right with you.  it's our honeymoon. we're going to use the trip to get to know each other better.
twenty!
stop bullying me. everybody's bullying me.
thanks, basil. maybe the nineties aren't so bad after all.
i won't be a moment.
you son of a bitch!
it's the rough-cut, the other side's new commercial.
one-third? that's about $7,000,000 isn't it?
i have been feasting with mine enemy, where on a sudden one hath wounded me, that's by me wounded; both our remeidies within thy help and holy physic lies.
something like that. will you do it?
damn!  this will get him.
sir--
i would like to say goodbye.
if i'm real, they'll get me out. if i'm not, they'll treat you. either way you'll be better off than you are now. you'll get a reward.
aw, come on, bill.  it's just business.
i found this today.  there were other pieces of the body lying there, but i believe "he" wanted me to have this...
'predate it.
no...as a matter of fact...
you don't have a clean glass in the house.
greg mcconnell.
the mooring hasn't come taught.
i'm here for an interrogation. you've been called a graffiti artist and i wanna know why. all i see are scribble scrabble abstractions!
it's perfect the line is busy?
what do you want?
yes, it is.  it must be one of the worst nights we have had this winter.
one.
but what are we going to do against this entire army?
before we do this, i just want to say that a good life's gotta be about more than achieving stuff -- like on your list.
goddamnit!
my license expired, let's get out of here.
what do you want to do?
yes?
jimmy... it's beautiful!
good evening, mrs. cook.
it's my fault. i shouldn't have...i didn't think...
i get off work in fifteen minutes. walk me home?
forget it.
they either say, 'kill the nigger' or 'hope you die, honky.' -- what ya got in the bag?
i don't want to make friends.
you have to leave the house immediately!
i think the moment that food hits your mouth we'll get a job.
i mean i finally understand what all the fuss is about.   this is just a whole 'nother ball game!
my friend carlos is doing it who works with me. it's his. it's his pudding, he's doing it. it's not mine. he's crazy. i told him not to do it. he's the one who's insane. he only spent about one hundred dollars so far though --
she was with you after she left frank.
exactly! i speak seven languages, including hebrew, so my specialty was synagogues. how about you? kill somebody?
don't you know the first thing you're supposed to do at a new post is present yourself to the commanding officer with your orders?
freezing. maybe a couple degrees over.
of course.
you're welcome, john.
and how do you go about getting an exorcism?
he leave you?
fats, look, i got about two hundred dollars here. you can't run out on me.
a restaurant in oakland. where no one would recognize us.
but he was called...
that's fine with me. keeps me out of trouble.
it's not for sale at any price.
i am not concerned, mr. harley, with the internal affairs of your planet. i consider that to be your business -- not mine.
yeah, but you know, i learned something today.  i learned that getting all worked up over fuck and shit and cockmaster is just stupid... you all focused so hard on erasing profanity that you forgot the most important thing... to love each other.
so i didn't fucking do it!
all right.  i'll get them!   go ahead - go ahead!  i'll catch up with you.
yes, sir, it's here on the truck, but it's pretty heavy -- i'll need help.
well, make it stop!
wait a minute. you want to look at fucking penguins now?
screw the generator!!
your majesty -- some men are content to read about things.  i must see them with my own eyes.  i cannot be other than i am.
i feel kind of sorry for him, all the same -
i didn't ask for your advice. 
nine.
pretty near. what do you know about the outfit we're going to?
try again, c'mon, try again.
you seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with dorothy vallens.
morning.
what?
well i got the tires rotated, i went shopping, and i made dinner.
no, that's fine.  i love that you tried... time was i'd have done the same.
what you say is wonderful! but sad...
that's what i was hoping you'd tell me.
he got caught! your boss tried to pull a switch and he got us all fucking pinched!
nothing. i just picked up the phone to say goodbye to you. you didn't say goodbye.
okay. soon? do you think i'm too fat?
yes -- that's right. production for use.
mimi?  ...  oh, dorothy's mother.  does she have to be up to something?
i'm glad. hopefully that will clear up the how-full-of-shit-i-am question you've been asking yourself. now, we're gonna have a little q and a, and, at the risk of sounding redundant, please make your answers genuine.  want a chesterfield?
the cards. the last thing i said to you was mind the cards.
that's easy. i'll explain that in a minute. this is your ticket. when you get on the bus here, the driver will take this part. you will ride to omaha. when you get to omaha, ask the driver. 'salt lake city, please. i do not speak english.'
gifford mayfair - i'll cook your tongue on a spit!    witches!
okay. bye.
i know who he is...
i was just leaning on it! it was an accident!
at first, no one will know why the victims are being killed.
all right.
don't get dirty, dad --
do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word? when he put me in that trance...
i should like you to do something for me. it's an innocent sort of thing but i'm very set on it.

oh, right ...
i came back for you; this morning i came back.  before i even knew about the money. you're what i want.  the only reason i stormed off is because you spooked me talking about jake.  but i've had nothing but time to think about it.  it keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here.  but we've got to get the money, baby.  we get the money, i get the car, then we get the hell out.

i can arrange that. i like that.
you talked to new york?
it does.
what's that mean?
i don't have no damn cover.

no, it isn't. i'm getting a divorce.
right away, ma'am!
young. i feel young, doctor.
or we could go another way 'cause your boss seems to like my face just the way it is.
you know what, nevermind.  you're not ready.
why?
possibly.  good.  well, would you be willing to accept the theory, george, that... possibly... by examining the evidence from one case we might shed some small ray of light on the other?  does that sound unreasonable to you?
margo, what you've just described is a killing machine.

she's coming.
jim court... no, this is her father.  i'll take...
i think she's acting.  i think she set it up to be alone with him because she wanted him to come on to her.  i think maybe she's upset that he didn't...
really?
so why did you decide to drive a taxi at night?
it's okay.
listen, if he has the guns he might have the money . . . i think we should go and see him.

when something's rotten in the land, bill, it generally isn't just one fish, we'll get corroboration... find this clay bertrand.  if i were a betting man, i'd give you 10 to 1 it's an alias.  start checking around the quarter.
let's work on it.
i was just going to sell it to friends.  i'm not a pusher, honest.

katherine.

damnation!  codfish and cockles! gammon and trotters!  you've bested me, jack.
i'm thinking it's too weird now.
hello second mate barnes. i was instructed to come to the bridge.
elegant words, sir, when you have made your name and your fortune on slander and innuendo and gossip. in your papers you taught the world how to look under every rock. i learned at the knee of the master.
can't it wait till morning?
you may step down.
he's from kansas city. i wouldn't be surprised if he was your rat.
it's always john.

i couldn't make it out -- too much interference.
yeah. did you have them both at once or --

guard! arrest these men! escort them to the cutter!
i didn't think you'd make it.

we wait.
the 'history'...?
martin van buren aldrich and my pa's the only democrat in cross corners. he said you had horns and a tall, mr. webster, but i ain't seen 'em yet.
it took some high-powered acting, believe me.
twenty months?
what's this, sir?
they did not!
i helped.
how was your date?
where's sean?
<u>why</u>?!
hide them?  on a date with pilots?  i'm talking about how you make them show!
thanks.  just give them the time he called.  they're keeping a list, supposedly.  sorry.  my nerves are so raw these days.
well it' s all you've got !
big.com. that internet thing.
her 'head'?! you're making this up...
i've just had a letter from your uncle. he won't be able to come when you take your vows.
i said, `i'm dead'. he killed me.
bacon cheeseburgers.
laundromats for the washing of money. unfortunately, carl had only one successful business.
i don't know.
well, i don't think i can remember it.
otis what?
you know what?  you can go.
i'm sure i don't know who you mean.
elaine, do you realize you can't stop talking about viktor?
we're going to paris?
then show a little spunk.  there <u>is</u> no b-2 bomber, general scott, the best of your knowledge, is not in seattle to talk with boeing...
good-night, folks.
all right, you didn't know.
oh, you will?
hello, birdy.
you don't recognise me? you had me barred. you fucking little worm.
i got greedy.  i decided to bring a little in on my own and somebody tipped you off.  that was my mistake. carl would never be so stupid.
get out!
wait a minute -  i've got it. there! off the port bow!
oh, no, sir.
agent mapp! thank you!
i'm picking up an unusual electromagnetic signature from the kolarin system.
well, you know, "the whole thing's theatre..."
almost.
it's called a dress.
i knew you were a loser the first night i laid eyes on you.
yes.
the person i cared about wouldn't have done this. everything out of your mouth has been a complete lie. i don't know you at all. for all i know you could hate dorothy parker.
yes!  yes!  oh, lord!  yes, oh, yes! but  where is the one who came last night -- all in yellow?!
when you asked a minute ago it was five-forty-two. it is now five forty-three. when you ask a minute from no, it will be-
we're gonna blow up the powder magazine.
if i gave you the impression i hated him i didn't mean to.  i... i hate the way he <u>behaves</u>... he's selfish and self-centered and cynical...
what the --
it's cosmetic. they don't cover cosmetic. last year i had a tooth capped. the dentist tells me i'm not covered for caps. it's cosmetic.
you don't wanta make any promises, mr. kane, you don't wanta keep.
do you pledge to guide and protect this child if he is left fatherless? do you promise to shield him against the wickedness of the world?
the house - tommi - something just doesn't jive here...
in twenty-four hours, zephram cochrane is supposed to conduct the very first warp test... from a missile silo in montana. if i'm right, the borg were trying to change the course of human history by killing him or destroying his ship.
if i find out buzz is comin' up short on dwarf bowling, it's lights out for him and pink slips for you. sid and breeze look sideways at each other.
no.
hi. i brought some wine.
god, i hate that time.  that pick up stuff time.  i just went through that before i came here.  you know that song "patsy cline times two" i play?  that's about me and my ex dividing up our record collections.
i can't. after the show.
of course.  you want them... it shall not take long.  wait here.
i don't want to be a martyr.
where's the challenge in that?
ricky's taken care of.
it was an accident, i'll get you a new one.
four cases in three years...
found it?
yeah, i was thinking...i mean, i'm a celebrity now, do i really want to get married? but on the other hand, if you're married, they can't testify against you.
i like those sapphire earrings myself.
doing fine, sir.
christ, they'll probably miss you and hit me.
no!  he's very alive.  well... sort of.  he's old, and frail -- but he's still bela lugosi!  and he's really nice.
it's because i wanted to keep you away from that world.
what sales?
some village in the mountains -- alethera, i think.
what did you think of him?
may i see my mother?
just as on your home planet, sir. if i may say, it took me three years to master the spikes, but now i sleep with a peace i never thought possible...
ah. yes, the little door.  there is a short film on the little door in the orientation room in exactly two minutes. if you hurry, you'll just make it.
this is quite a place.
what's wrong?
don't flatter yourself.  i always liked that line.
no, of course, you want to get out of town.
what a coincidence? i'm a male synchronized swimmer and i'm looking for representation.
it's just -- the pain.  it's only getting worse.  i can't be a good wife.  i can't be a good mother.
thought you might find that.
and if the truth is so horrible that it will haunt your dreams for all time?
amy, listen to me. death isn't such a terrible thing.
no.
could emma be the name of the girl he's going to kill?
my mother's family is french, my father's was german, originally.
pick up a burger for fred. he's going crazy. 
did you now?
i am not john wayne.  there is no "s" on his chest.  we get down if the play calls for it.  but we are into business and making money.
...one more day.
no...  it can't be.
you just woke up this morning and suddenly decided to run for president?
what?
what did you want?
...why?
no.  yes.  i mean, depends on --
i won't need to sir, it's already here, behind the barricade so...
why you gotta front me like that? i'm talking to kip --
i'm coming with you.
oh, rekall.
oh louis, louis...
follow the mustang.  we won't go far.
what  ?
she'll think i betrayed her.
--yes you are, sean. you resent me. and i'm not going to apologize for any success that i've had.
well... for a start... er... there's no killing...
that's it.  get out.
we're gonna get out of here, nick. we're gonna get out of this...
are you crazy?
almost two a.m.
it's okay.  last one.
listen, deak, what if bubber <u>has</u> got something to hide?  what if he's the wrong guy, not really the hero...?
she's obviously dealt with this guy before.
i'll pay lilly back, don't you worry about that.
you must be igor.
yeah, but i didn't get him, i got his case and now he's behind the tree. what can i do?
she's waiting in the conference room.
i'm a girl who keeps her promises.
relax. tomorrow this will all seem like a bad dream. goodbye.
cut.
where have you been for the last seven years?
oh, no.
bobby cooper.
i don't think so.
duh hickey.
how about you?
what's up?
i'm taking you back.
i'm not accusing you...
yes, i do.  whatever's out there, i think is his response to us refusing to talk to him earlier.
you don't understand.
that junior chick?
you ain't shot.
something like that.
name it.
i've come to know you. you're honest.  i trust you.
now that's a crap company, sure you'll make money on the takeover rumor, but what's being created. nothing. no substance behind it.
lot of turnover these days. better tell them to get in touch with me if they want to hang onto their land.
<u>now</u> you can bring the vehicle to a stop: there on the left.
helluva time for vanity!
jordan, dear.  how are they treating you?
i know. i mean i'm sitting there and her father's asking me about my "career prospects" and i'm playing "risk," with her kid brother, leon and at dinner the dog's sniffing at my balls -- at least i hope it was the dog. 'cause her mother disappeared for a while.
don't start a war on my wedding day!
yes, chauncey gardiner.
i want you to meet some people.
you wanna take me to a kung fu movie?
i loved my taxi. went twelve hours nonstop. stopped only to pee. i peed under the manhattan bridge. peed many times in parks and playgrounds.
this is what we laughingly refer to as a plan, right?
when the grey hair is dead, magua will eat his heart. before he dies magua will put his children under the knife so the grey hair will see his seed is wiped out forever.
i'm sorry, i don't know who you mean.
there are no saints today. good people yes, but extraordinarily good people... those i'm afraid we are sorely lacking.
you want to tell me about it?
give me the page.
ow!
who? i mean besides the fbi?
i was fooling, silly.  you need a cigarette, because you used to smoke but you quit except when you finish a book, and you just have one, and the match is to light it. and you need one glass of champagne.  dome pear-igg-non.
um-hm. you got the five hundred?
well, then, i--i *thank* you, miss saunders! nothing better could have happened--. yes *sir*, miss saunders, we're going right ahead with it!
see you, ginger.
is it awfully violent?
you don't want to be sheriff.
but she must be able to move. everything is in place.
shit. i met her on the plane and i had all that acid.  you know, those little blue barrels. i gave her a cap before i realized... she's a religious freak... jesus, she's never even had a drink.
we're ticketed to fly back from baltimore, anyway.
for now.
oh, hi ...
'praise jesus?' that's fucking pushing it, margaret.
congratulations.
he says here good-bye.  i find it in his room.  he is sorry, he says. he has had a wonderful life.
no. let her get at least one more peacefully night's sleep.
oh the preacher's getting angry again...  tell me something.  did she die instantly or did she feel every torn muscle and shattered bone? were you there to help her?  or were you safe at home when the windshield sliced into her face --
it needs more time to charge.
i picked you for your verve, your excellence, and for your ability to - how shall i say - instruct.  you've lived a first-rate life.  and i find it eminently usable.
then don't.
that's my girl!
y'what?
not "we", sidney, you!
right, right, what am i thinking of?
i prefer not to push the engines until they've been properly run in.
... a friend of mine's gonna get herself killed. i need my clip.
you didn't hear something?
nobody's been talking to nobody. you don't have a case, you hear me? it's pure and simple. now leave me alone. okay?
nothing.  i just prefer the other one.
you got to learn everything the white man says and use it against him. the truth is laying there if you smart and read behind their words. it's buried there. you got to dig it out.
well...
good luck, david.
his name is will turner -- that's all i found out.
it's a living.
no buts! accept what's done, louis. what we done was right. another time it might not be, but tonight it was... at least i hope to christ it was. now you make your call...but not a word about tonight.
i . . .
listen, matt. if you don't tell the truth, i can't help you. where were you last night?
yeah, must be especially tough to take over under these circumstances.
as long as there isn't a fire hydrant.  what i've gone through --
no, jasper, nobody's gonna kill us.
the bogyman!
it's his mixture!  too much oxygen!
kill him.
it makes sense; hunt worked for the c.i.a. and the white house was paranoid about teddy kennedy.
that, you have to discuss with cbs business affairs. but, for something like this, i would say anywhere between 10, 12 thousand.
i'm fine, right. fit as a fucking fiddle.
oh -- sure, sure! never better!
serious?! who the hell does he think he is? you're the most popular month on the usc calendar!
oh, no!  i mean, everyone thinks things like that.
how far's the river from here, mose?
i told the guy i didn't want to talk to...
and they get caught!
interesting choice of words. i don't remember. i just know that i want to.
yes, but he was a cop.
come now. so much anger for such a little crime? are you sure there is nothing else troubling you?
amen to that.  the supermarket's full of assholes.
he thought i had your father's money, so he got me out of the way while he looked for it.
i didn't want to do it, don jorge. they made me ...
...you brought thirty years of medical experience to bear.  isn't that what you did?
argentina! lula, you're outta your mind. now you just tell me where you are and i'll come for you. i won't say nothin' to the police about sailor, i promise. he can do what he wants, i don't care.
how can you do that? you don't live anywhere near that school.
a book on some of the most infamous murderers in america. i want to go to where they lived and where they killed and i want you to photograph it.
what'll i say?
don't we already have someone to do that for us?
if he wants to go.
and the other one -- he is like you?
no, sir.
home?  this is your home. you're dead.
because to follow the game he played he had to move to that grid?
what?
it doesn't matter, i'm not staying long... i just want to make sure i convince you not to give up yet.
-- c'mon, stephen.
no i didn't see anybody i know. no i don't want to go to school here tomorrow. i want to go home.
hi.  i've been looking for an envelope of my receipts from last month and i'm thinking i didn't take them with me.  have you seen them around?
i didn't ask for a closing argument.
to haul some cargo. my nephew, he is captain of a sub in the black sea fleet.
it's always in the more gifted of the three.
cash.
--separate, in the evening..."
you know, if you ever got me, you wouldn't have a clue what to do with me. that's the thing, romeo.
you hate my guts? i want you to come with me now.
yes, yes, but...
we adjust to what there is to adjust to.  perhaps paul, being young, can adjust to joy or grief immediately.  i hope he can.  i will take a little longer.  i'll be as quick as i can.
hmm.  let's aim higher.
great.
she's already here.  she arrived before you and she'll leave long after you've gone.  remember, under no circumstances are you or any other person to enter the set without my express permission.
what do you mean?
gosh, i'm sorry, we better get in line.
you didn't have to...
where?
i love the outfits.
san agamat chay bet... envolet!
good. now i want to ask you fellows a couple of questions. did earl williams know what he was doing when he fired that gun?
no, i don't! you know, i was in a record store. listen to this- so i know there's this big tall blond crew-cutted guy and he's lookin' at me in a funny way and smiling and he's saying, "yes, we have a sale this week on wagner." wagner, max, wagner- so i know what he's really tryin' to tell me very significantly wagner.
you pig!
sixty-nine cent.
wait a minute.  my birthright is in the graveyard?  later not.
but...i...400 years?
okay, if that's all that we've been through together means to you, i guess it's better if we just said goodbye, once and for all! you know, it's funny, after all the serious talks and passionate moments that it ends here... in a health food restaurant on sunset boulevard. goodbye, sunny.
i know.  he's wonderful, isn't he?
thank you.
it never happened. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          117.
dad, it's not about that. i just need to know that it's possible for two people to stay happy together forever. or at least for a few years.
'bye, johnny...
meaning?
you win.
from the store.
oh.
you almost killed me, asshole! if i had any idea what type of guy you were, i never would've agreed to work with you.
in that little pissant car of yours? hell, no.  i ain't gettin' no back pain disability retirement -- i'm gettin' me a full pension and a real gold-plate seiko watch.
because... i didn't think i would?
verdado where?
no, bennie: lumbago.
he isn't.
the morning?
what?
what? whatta you mean, no? who is -- who is telling you? whatta you mean, no? yes, you'll wear pink or else. or else you'll wear pink.  and, darlin', oh, i'm gonna take you to coney island.
i can't promise you anything.
really, that's a long time.
he said he'd consider it. it's between you and rodriguez.
i want to ask you something.
we ain't never gonna find that girl now.
what?
oh, yes, what?  you'd <u>bribe</u> me, to, to, to, "release" you...?
no thanks.
a week ago it was my business, now it's none of my business. in other words, when you need me to take care of somethin' for you, then you need me.
i guess that's what i'm doing, then.
who are you to decide if you should live or die?
not for a dog.
...so you saved hanukkah mr. big shot. i mean, let's be honest mordechai, it isn't even one of the high holidays.
it's focus.  every opponent has a weak spot.  you ignore everything around you, and put all your energy into one perfect strike.
[and one of the founding members of la hermanidad.]
rita hayworth at the morgue and now veronica lake with white. what the hell's going on?
she wasn't really my wife.
how much longer before we get to "frankenstein"?
god. people exaggerate so much at this school.
<u>expected</u>... offer.
which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up. but he's got it, captain.
you're nothing but a bunch of goddamn romantics.  you're never going to amount to anything.
what?
don't be late.
thank you.
gum thought brazil.
another fragment of the diary is shown [having to do with vampires].
nope.
a little.
yeah, then we'd be stuck here.
six.
that i would find the one.
that's what i'm not supposed to say.
i guess it proves you really care about me. you hung in there.
anyone else?. alright jeffrey, just a minute.
who are you?  rome?  paris?  treadstone...both of us...i was warned but...
of course you are.  you couldn't do those terrible things.  come home with me  -  maybe things will make sense then...
who is he? what have you got me into?
kiss off.
this... seemed best.
eight.  size eight.
i tell you, this station will be operational as planned.
you think i'm <u>that</u> nuts?
i like talking about it.  at least, to you.
i had an idea your husband was getting suspicious.
no.
shit!  don't take this the wrong way, but i used to fuck her.
we should've gone to dorsia. i could've gotten us a table.
you want to change rooms?
are you worried?
yeah, you and debbie and perfect --
you guys always look great.
the big boy did...?
okay...
won't they come out here?
yeah, but you said, "will it change my wife"!
yeah, actually i do.
uh, i'll try...
it matters, mr. crawford... other cops know who you are. they look at you to see how to act... it matters.
what's compassion, mister.
what?
i still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  i was merely a spectator.
i don't recollect ever being compared to a pistol before.
about what?
is he circumcised? can you imagine what his anus is like? describe it to me. would you like to sodomize him? would you like to put your penis right into his anus, thrust it up his anus? tell me, describe it to me. tell me what you would do. how would you kiss him in that car? describe how you'd reach over and unzip his greasy jeans, then take out his penis. would you kiss it or suck it right away? which hand would you hold it in? have you ever sucked a penis? do you know what semen tastes like? have you ever tasted semen? some semen is saltier than others. vaughan's semen must be very salty...
you know, the whole world thinks you killed freddie? it's terrible.
what are you getting so hot about -- tommy como told him to come down here...
right.
beth shalom? what are you talking about? who is this...?
i want the gun emptied.  i want to see all six slugs tossed up here. and then i want out.  that's all. <u>out</u>!
your faith in the veracity of the major media is touching, jerry.  it indicates that the age of innocence is not yet over.  but seriously, jerry, people aren't interested in jim garrison - they want the hard evidence!  they want to know why he was killed and what forces were opposed to...
it's a rave!  boy, if i ever fake my death, they'll really miss me.
what he said. we didn't know jack shit about and riot. it just happened. it was kismet. we didn't even know those people. how are we supposed to organize a riot when we've been in fuckin' isolation for the past year? just bleep out the fucks and jack shits.  i mean, it's not like we care. if they wanna say we masterminded the whole thing, let 'em. it won't exactly keep us up at night. but you said you wanted the truth, and the truth is we were just lucky.
walked.
if...  if... when we get to san francisco...  if they're already there?
what's this i see? is that whiskey in them glasses on the bar? roderick, i'm gonna have to cite you for a violation of state law--
it's not a guy...
it's scurvy's.  his date got convicted. where'd you get the dress?
we all stick to this, it's smooth sailing.
why do you interfere with my little romances?
no ...
hi, is this jack?
you are so full of shit...
what?
ray borrowed this whole tub of money against this balloon payment that i don't get if i qu -- it's too complicated. i -- besides...
these appointments were not my idea, remember.
you said it was going to be social, giles. no business.
we know.  we know.  yo, check it, my black brothers, we can't let this slide.  not this injustice. nah, no way.  dem' two real coons iz ill.
i told you. i'm like positive.
things get tough next winter, you'll have somethin' to wear.
bring him over sometime. i have some other stuff to show him.
yeah.  too good.  i forgot where i was.
the engines are dead. we're drifting.
don't go telling anyone.  it'll ruin my reputation.
you were asleep.
it's not that i don't appreciate the offer...
yes.  absolutely.
why, craig. why?
fuckin' a. it's gotta!
yeah, this is skinny.
nervous?
yes.
i shouldn't have left her.
so tell calvin.
was this trip really necessary?
no. it's all over.
the un is far away, dear sir. it is easier to make oneself heard with bombs. if i were in their place, i would use bombs.
like you?
do you know?
and see when i get out of here. i've got plans. going to get myself straightened out and head off to thailand, where women really know how to treat a guy. see, out there you can live like a king if you've got white skin and a few crisp tenners in your pocket. no fucking problem.
that's right.
no, no.  it's not good-god you all! it's good-god, ya'll.  ya'll!
-- she's not dead! just have to get her heart pumping aqain!
he was a nice horse.
granted.  where are you going?
i am sorry, but i cannot stop myself. i think something is wrong
coming on line now, sir.
i'm afraid so; he's an idealist. you'll have to be politic.
don't be ridiculous.
that is sedition! treason!
i'll put you on another job. you need never see him again, eh?
yeah and what would i say?
junot?
something seem unusual to you about that?
sure, it's a meal ticket for me. i admit it, but it's also a windfall for somebody like mr. norton who's trying to crash national politics.  that's what you bought the newspaper for, isn't it? you wanta reach a lotta people, don't you?  well, put john doe on the air and you can reach a hundred and fifty million of 'em. he can say anything he wants and they'll listen to him.
why should i help that old fuck.
you know, i've always been fascinated by show business.
i know you think that.
i'd never admit that.
it's not my job to believe you.
blackheart.  aptly named.
you hustlin' me?
i ask only a payment on account today -- after that, you will find me undemanding, obedient and discreet.
that's it!
but listen, glenn.  if you're lying to me...
no self respecting shark is gonna take a bite out of you.
in that case, i permit you.
otis!!!!
i know.  it was a joke.
your parents' wake. rain fell like tears.
yeah.  maybe he'll call.
no, he was real.  like on tv.
oh, for christ's sake, walter!
might as well be.
no, he doesn't. and i don't want you here. just go, please.
clemenza promised them nothing, he hated the sonsuvbitches.
i'm not crying.
i'm sorry to call, but i need that stuff...
good thing there's not a red line on you, j-man. yeah!
yes.
and pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it.
what do you mean?
i'm sorry.  i'm just so happy that you're safe.
almost all of them.
jos - maybe you should turn it down.
in a manner of speaking.  i've never encountered the olfactory hallucinations, but i'm sure they're related.
i like an olive.
you here for the summer?
objection!
if i get let off. otherwise, fuck 'em.
no.
he should've had me. goose take it down. let's bug out of here. call for a draw.
slink!  hang on!
claudia.
i can't screw.  i can't screw.
power surge... the transmission beam's too strong!
what would you know about a normal frame of mind?
it is not.
i just want to get married.
man?
no.
who else would hire me?  beat you to it, didn't i?  oh yes, almost forgot- brought you a little welcoming gift. 
couple of fractures, lacerations. they say he's gonna be all right.
don't think i won't.
this is my way of telling you --
visiting hour ends at eight thirty. i'll just sit with him; i want to show respect.
goodbye. i lov... 
you scurvy shyster bastard! watch your language! you're talking to a doctor of journalism!
i'll call from work.  we can have a conference call.
huh! and they say charity’s only rewarded in heaven... hallelujah...  christ...
because it's a job?
i'm with you on that. and don't you think it needs a good female part? increase the romance angle.
no prisoners. don't worry, frank, just a little psychological first aid.
you went out with her?
i got this cousin. he's a real doofus, but he claims he can become invisible.
i'll be right out.
i do not think you anything anymore.  just back from the hospital and already you are chasing after boys.
we're stuck with this fucking shit...
i don't wanna stick out my tongue.
get away from there.
sergeant... i'd like to thank you for what you're doing.
i don't know any hell -
yes.
you mustn't tell anybody, or it won't come true.
it'll just be a few days.
yes...
yes, can i help you ? maybe a donut or something ?
about the mail --
bobby laid his own tracks.  he could have gone quietly but he played the hard-ass con till the end. and as far as i'm concerned, he wife and kid are a hell of a lot better off without him.  now take the money.
listen to me. the press ban is killing us and the distributors won't book it. and meantime i'm dealing with the stockholders in new york who are scared shitless -- and i'm this far from getting fired myself -- and you don't have a friend in the world but me right now. so you have got to trust that i'll do what i can to--
look kat it'll only take ten minutes. without jahn i might never find it... we'll just have a quick look and then you and i'll hit a tram.
no, i think i'll drink it in here, thanks.
then how is time travel possible?
uh, i would say these people are going to cost a million dollars over the next two years ...
alright... hey, did you hear any more about what happened last night?
i don't know.
forget it.
oh. eh, i like it.
and what does that mean?  are you insane?!  you think i would hurt lois?! she's the mother of those kids! what is wrong with you?
you must have some money.
nothing like a little liveliness.
david, please --
he's up on the bridge!  he's going to be ok.  now who's missing?
sometimes neither.
it was a crime.
did you tell that to marco when he did his what-does-it-all-mean thing with you?
his paws are frozen and he cannot walk.
i can help them!
jimmy?
i have to get to the airport...
-- 73, and divorce is as easy as paying off a traffic ticket, and for crying out loud, ben, be a man and just get it over with. i would have if i'd had the chance.
what is it?
for what?
sure i'm alright. 
sir?
temporarily?  uh...sure....
shut up, you dummy.  who did this to you?
feel good?
too bad you're not more like your father.
you should have been a marriage counselor.  but i'll show you what's wrong with your theory.
racket? what do you mean?
of course. we never left the air. i know - i didn't sleep the whole night long.
it grows on you.
maybe i'd better go before i catch something.
hulk was dumb as shit.
i don't know if i'd go that far.
i wanted to talk to you, and i have one last thing to take care of at school. then i'm going to...  good dog, rusty. good dog.
i just need you for another minute now, so we can shoot from behind towards me, and, um...
really? why?
let's go, sonny.
i don't want it. but why don't you stay and finish your drink.
damn right i did it. went back and set the house on fire, his little floozy testified in court - and i ended up doing ten years at rikers, got my teeth knocked out by mike the dyke.
i'm not sure. but i think they're worried about you.
yes --- and that's putting it mildly! no certified check -- no story -- get me?
it will and you know why? because you're not a person anymore, you're a cadet in the united states army; you have no identity, no miranda warning, and no rights. so i'm gonna throw you to the wolves, and unlike you, i'm gonna get away with it, because you're pissing me off!
baby names?
lucy isn't you. we're losing something without you being here. now, i know this is a rough time for you, but i think we should make another arrangement.
a nozh scrap any time you say. dim weakens.
the russians. on the other side of the river.  all you have to do is hang on for a few more weeks.
louis, are you sure?
oh, no, no, no.  it, uh, it-it-it- it was i-inevitable that hannah and i part, anyway.
the hotel guy?  it's been in the papers lately.  his kids are all suing each other over his estate. he was a total recluse, paranoid, rich as hell, he was worth thirty million or something, now it turns out they can't find half of it.  somebody took something didn't belong to them!
you mean that?
i'm afraid not. you see, we observe things that you're unaware of: signs, indicators. your problem cuts very deep, frances, and we have to get at that deeper stuff so that when you do get out, you'll really feel secure. does that make sense?
if you say so.
it's not gonna happen.
that's enough, bobby. i think it's time you went to bed.
working with a dead man. shit, i've done about everything else.
what happened is that jimmy went to meet a guy called teddy. he took a lot of money with him and he didn't come back. jimmy's partners think i set him up. i don't know whether you know this teddy or how well -
mr. henry has an inside source. we call him steve. that's where we get our information.
matt, come here!
how is that possible?
man, why do you keep asking me that?
i don't believe it.
yeah, it's mine.
leave me alone!
i just want to make sure that you both --
come on, harry. this is america, land of the free.  i thought we might go skinny dipping.  for starters.
we were trying to scare your mother.
naturally.
i don't know... but i'm sure he's not sleeping.
mr. smith -  -- the "complimentary couch."
yeah, you know when bette comes up to the guy on the porch, gives him a flirty look and says, 'i'd kiss you, but...'
okay, arms up, lean forward.
what?
he's fine. just had a bad fall.
it's okay.  what happened?
that sounds very simple, dickson, but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes?
see, i can't do it. i came out of the desert.
i know.  i don't always do exactly what i'm told.  so i said, 'do you enjoy watching me?'  and you said -- come on max.
remember, it has poor eyesight.  it hunts with its sense of smell.  so for god's sake, margo, don't get those fibers on your clothes!
stay forever.
murderer.
good night.  and i am very grateful to you.
i've talked to doctor emlee, and he says...
i don't know...
hey, about everything that happened with sarah.  i know you did what you could--
i knew him for twenty years - at least i thought i knew him. i suppose he was laughing at fools like us all the time.
because pasta should be eaten "al dente".  so the trinket will just have to wait a bit.
well, i've felt that way, hadn't you?
i saw what i saw.
this is different. this is important. how many?!
i'm glad we didn't.
where do i pull off...?
don't shoot me, i'm friendly.  you can use that when you surrender.
i honestly don't know. maybe to have someone to cover for him. and i wish i could, but there's no doubt in my mind he killed those men.
i thought maybe we could have a bite to eat first -- and then --
my golly, you know?  all my life i grew up in the city, but every summer...would you like a cigar?
hallelujah.
very funny.  i saw you out there on lane five. what do you have the flu or something?
marty, i don't want you hang arounna house tonight. i want you to go take a shave and go out and dance.
are you scared?
huh?
oh, you know... drink beer, tell ghost stories. they try and spook each other out, talking about zombies and things...  it's no big deal, chase. i did it when i was young.
how long were you and eduard --
you mean about that gun?
aw, you can sleep, hon.
yes.
yes.  very.
i'll be there in an hour.
uh-huh.  well, miss moran, what is it you'd like to do for us?
you fucked carlton? see i told you he liked you.
right.  and then communication satellites, and then anywhere.
no, boy. thirty-eight cents worth of gas. and watch you don't make it thirty-nine.
albert.
george, glad you could make it, son. hi, doll.
yeah.  you should have seen it. we were the hit of the show with the new model ordering system, the one for the 680... how you can write up an order and the second the customer's name goes into the computer, it starts checking their credit, and if they've ordered anything in the past, and if they get a discount...
pardon?
but what if we leave them behind?
no!
look, a lot of that stuff goes back a long way.  and it's between me and him and it has nothing to do with you.
there's got to be an explanation!
hello.
you and me with long faces -- plunged into despair -- because we find out that a man didn't kill his wife. we're two of the most frightening ghouls i've ever known.
ah! my lady! the tide waits for no man, but i swear it would wait for you!
umm, i'm trying to find out her greatest achievement.
what, right now?
that's the problem. i can't afford to give her anything.
yes, of course. we both had fish. why?
you're movin' to death row. see, your fingerprints are now on the murder weapon of four fbi agents. and when i turn this into the lab, they're gonna find lafontaine all over it. and we already know...  ...this is your mo.
i'm a volunteer, am n't i?
yes; from the first night.
we had dinner at a restaurant.
i don't care anyway.  i want the coffin to be white.  and i want it specially lined with satin. white, or deep pink.
asshole. but she won't miss anything, that. you'll see.
this ain't george's doing--!
no. no, i'm fine. maybe i should go. i mean... i don't want our first time to be like this.
how the hell would i know? i wasn't a philosophy major.
i don't know, but you seem sort of distant.
bastard!
i saw your eyes when you hit that guy with your ball on tv. thunder rumbles. theo takes sheila by the shoulders.
are we leaving, captain?
no.
out.
i want to know how, where -- if you don't tell me, i'm going to call daddy.
we are launching a major offensive to expand our foraging territory...
ten days.  there going to be any back end in this thing?
maybe i don't see it that way.
maybe six feet. lanky. i didn't get a good look. he was far away. but i saw him. i saw him as sure as you're standing there.
alright.  go ahead.
were you always this sick?
if it makes you feel better that took every ounce of self control i had. trevor, i never date patients.
what?
you owe me a copy of the beach boys greatest hits, volume two.
but then it is better this way, don't you think?  no loose ends.
and end up a hunchback like my old man? you think i'm crippled? you shoulda caught him the end of a day.
no, sid.
we'd be sitting ducks in the freezers.
why?
you see, even the voice.
take the picture out.
you're more than that. i've had example of the fact that wild horses couldn't pull confidential matter in these two offices out of you. that's why i tell you what i do--about smith and this situation. so, you see--
yeah. and an actor.
jim, what is going on, for heaven's sake!  you going to stay up all night every night?  for what?  so you'll be the only man in america who read the entire 26 volumes of the warren report?
we're watching the movie, harry. you got that!  we are watching my fucking movie.
so your memory's coming back?
i know who he works for. where's your phone.
are you going to quit? my last bodyguard quit.
you pull a muscle or something?
yeh, this time anyway.
i told you before, you wouldn't understand.
i dined at the prison.
oh, yeah.  scared the hell out of skipper.
ugh!
i've always respected bree.  i'd like to make something clear.
a man of the cloth?
completely.
stay here.  don't go anywhere. just stay here.
my daughter lives right across the street from the satan's disciples' clubhouse, and i was so worried about her ... so, i went over and introduced myself. and they were the nicest people.
he was killed serving project mayhem.
it's for the pick-nick. and you won't get a smidgen of my fudge unless you stay for the pick-nick!
misty, if you want to lose weight go ahead, but do it for yourself, not for some boy you barely know.
and if there is, then zero can kill someone?
the cops have it locked in and i got my people there visiting pop all the time.  what about the hit list.
yeah, sure... i got a couple of hours before i have to be at the victory.  want to grab a beer?
you heard me - keep away from him
strawberry ain't shit. drug pussy.  me.  i swing like reggie. mr. october. number three, game six, world series.
why not! there's a bill up in congress to give us a uniform law of bankruptcy. daniel webster is fighting for it right now--
get the hell out!
<u>you</u> <u>gotta</u> <u>be</u> <u>kidding</u>.
i sure as hell got my wish.  she doesn't exist.  so maybe you reached the appropriate person after all.
it's either meatloaf, swiss steak or charred flesh. i won't know till it's finished.
c'mon, chief, if it's sensitive, tell me .. i'm not taking notes ..
with four of them, i didn't use any kind of protection. wait, maybe it was three.
hooper, matt hooper. from the oceanographic institute. 
what?  what is it?
hugh, take care of the nekhorvich memory card.
...which is strange 'cause this is less than 20 minutes after the assassination.
i will, david!
evil?  do you believe in evil?
some day. when i'm sure i can do a better job of it than my folks.
follow him? mr. gekko i...  it's not what i do. i could lose my license. if the sec found out, i could go to jail. it's inside information, isn't it?
agent.
for everything.
that wasn't luck, johnny boy.  that was smarts and ten plus on the job.
it's okay, honey. i got you. i got you. you're okay.
right.
it's a good face. i like it. i like george bailey. tell me, did he ever tell anyone about the pills?
yeah.
isn't everybody part of everybody else?
this boy's crazy. they wiped the floor with him. they beat his brains out and he wants to go back.  what for? to take another beating?
cut the shit, sonny, and get out of here before you get yourself in some very serious trouble. he rocks the giant phallus which has a special weight swinging inside causing it to swing up and down an eccentric motion.
i love you.
give me one more day, sir. the damage control is easy. reading klingon is hard.
thank you, i can see that.  try something else.
take me home, diz.
i'd say the opposite - hypertension.
you want fair pay, make hamburger for mickey d. otherwise, please to sign.
it's your play.
because you're... different.
it tastes like fish.
"..in which all the history of the universe resides ..all the strength..all the hope..protect us from evil.."
oh yes, icky.  i can feel it.
i can't say it's a surprise.
it's fine.  i can bleep it out.
my friends have a country house we can use for a while.
i think you should leave now, robert.
of all people you should know what it means to want some peace and quiet-
now it's a bomb.
i'm jp monroe, you stupid little bitch. now get the fuck out of my life.
very...  so, who you working for these days eric?
you can crash at stifler's?
they'll cut you down.
saw him do it?
there should be an access hatch nearby...
it makes perfect fuckin' sense to me. eddie, you didn't see how he acted during the job, we did.
rejoice in life while yet the small lamp burns.
perhaps you think no man would return to me.
my jury's still out on that,
no.
except i won't have a father anymore.
of course ... look, if she was a liverpool scrubber ...  eh, fella, you want to try pulling the other one, it's got a full set of bells hanging off it ... y'what? ... i know your sort, two cokes and a packet of cheese and onion crisps and suddenly it's love and we're stopping in an empty shop doorway. you're just after me body and y'can't have it ... so there!!
the night you came to me in this room -- to comfort me, to help me -- i turned you away.
love you too.
-- what?
this is about your daddy's death?  hell, lee, you know my father died on the job. you could have told me...  this is about more than all that, isn't it?  this is about your daddy's last case, right?
i always go a size smaller.  makes me look slimmer.
of course? i thought he was dead.
a loan officer?
i am sorry, madame. it is not permitted.
a record of the arrests...
i'll see you at mass tomorrow. we'll sit down and we'll discuss the whole thing.
they always paid.
we should just do it.
that's a "rookies" doll. george sanford brown. we gotta lotta dolls. they're real cool. did you know they came out with dolls for all the actors in "the black hole"? i always found it funny somewhere there's a kid playin' with a little figure of earnest borgnine.
kincaid got a little frisky last night...so, meet here at eight and go from there?  by the way, i'm brock leviathan.
joe, you don't know how glad i am you're aboard.  anybody who can take some of the weight off the old man, i'm in his corner.
no joke, lieutenant.
don't get cocky, girl.
no, son! we wait for night.  now...is precisely when... we must be at our... most cautious.
you know you did!
jackson, steinem...
uh-huh.  what's going on?
well, i'm really am most awfully sorry but i ... i can explain everything ...
everybody wants that, dear -- it doesn't exit...  sorry... didn't mean to interrupt.
up and around?  soon?
silent night, violent night...
that's okay. i get messed with all the time and when i saw him doing that to you i just lost it. i hate when people take advantage of tourists. it ruins it for the rest of us.
what does time travel have to do with philosophy?
you gonna tell on me?
i think you do.  better yet, i don't think anything was stolen because nothing was there in the first place. and i think mr. smith, whoever he is, now knows that.
get out of my way.
like fish.
you haven't changed a bit.  always so sure of yourself.  even when we were kids, when you wanted something, nothing could stop you.
what are you doing back?!!
twenty.
oh won't i?
just being obstinate, sir. i'll handle it.
who?
you're still afraid.
anon, good nurse. anon.  master shakespeare?!
oh, yeah, very tough. but i guess that's good... to keep out the quacks.
...i got muscled on the street.
did you get headaches before this?  but you get more now? or more severe?
yeah. and you're not getting anything out of it.
please.  we don't need to talk about drew.
why?
ok, call 'im up and arrange a meeting, so we can get through all the getting to know you stuff.
what about me?
lemme guess.  the lottery.
fletch...
mitch.
how tired you are!
let me have some apple pie, helen.  who said anything about war? all i said was that some gulls...
which room is it?
the adm! be careful, andy. it's very powerful. how do you know about it?
no, richie, what do i look like?
well, if all you care about is basketball, why you fucking me?  go fuck dick vitale.
two and a half days?
yes.
no way doug, i can't.
tell me what?
why don't you just split?  you don't love him, anybody can see that.  and to him you're just some kinda possession, like a ferrari, something to show the other guys.
dancing.
you bastard!!
you're preparing him for a career in the slaughterhouses of dubuque?  take care of your body, yes!  but don't become a bender of horseshoes and railroad spikes.  don't become obsessed by your musculature.  any one of these poor, dead animals here was a thousand times the athlete you can ever hope to be. their magic was in their muscles. your magic is in your brains!
just a thought.
thank you very much.
jeanne, you can't leave us like this!
is this a contract violation, mr. cobb?
look he's a mixer and a trouble maker!
i don't want to drag this out too long for jeremy.
<u>what</u>?
puffy, get over here.
when you're hitting you shouldn't think about anything but hitting.  but you shouldn't think about it too much.  the trick is to use your brain to not use your brain.
well, in that case, couldn't you -- ?
we've been operating in the red for years.  that was the whole idea behind the superstition exhibit.  it was designed to pull people in. we've spent every penny we have on advance publicity, betting everything on the opening's success. if we postpone at the last minute... no.  i don't want to think about that.
surely you can't be serious.
houdini mice.
randolph!
yeah.
soiled with dirt, foul; sullen, hostile, forbidding -- as a black day. foully or outrageously wicked, as black cruelty. indicating disgrace, dishonor or culpability.
there was this other place where they served live monkey brains. sweat to god. you walk in, they bring the little monkey out, shave his head, crack it open, and you eat it's brains while it's still alive. i didn't go in, though, 'cause i didn't have any money and my mom has a saying: "don't write any checks you can't cash".
i have to.
you did what?!?
he can't be far away.  find him. go!
in a few minutes....
the penitent man will pass. the penitent... the penitent. the penitent man...
this party is for you and bob.  get your mind off the reporter.
he's in back.  lying face down. they haven't hurt him anymore -- but he was crying.  i never heard jack cry before --
ellie, there is no reason you have to be alone.
go get tom an' al.  i dunno what to do. i got to feed the fambly. what'm i gonna do with these here?
mmm, that's a good one.  maybe his echo...  okay, no more stalling.
wasn't supposed to be back till six. fucker rolls in at five.
yeah.
you gotta love the pirates, baby. the pirates are money.
you're the tribune man?
i don't know your real name.
what are you talking about?
no, mr. danvers.
i'm leaving.
good luck.
it doesn't bother me either.
i dunno. i think he had the piece of skin under his tongue removed so he could stick it out farther. i'm not too up on gene trivia.
the stripper's here.
oh, terri ...
the lewis and clark just returned from patrol in the asteroid belt, she's docked in bay four.
you volunteered, didn't you?  aren't we paying you for this?
i'm not in the fourth dimension --  -- you are in the fourth dimension, when you allow skepticism and doubt to take control. as blake said, if god had doubt the sun would go out.
this time of the year...?
i can't. what if it's the wallaces!? we'd get annie in trouble.
a gag. a gag!
just a second now. that's your truck. isn't it?
i drank like ten tons of sunny delight. anyway, yeah. i'm pregnant. and you're shockingly cavalier.
like the shields reed said would protect us.  how long?
buddy, the days of the debutantes are ... not what they used to be.
but how do you know for sure, you have to try to find a way to fig --
i can't believe...
what for?
son.
he's just loaded, honey.
i bought it. twenty-nine ninety-five on sale at goldbaum's tv and radio.  well, that just about takes care of it, i guess. you'll be able to watch the ball games. you know, as a little break from your work. 
it couldn't have been out at glades, if that's what you're thinking.  i was never out there.
i'm a proper citizen, i'm a decent man, i don't do anything that isn't decent or proper.  i know i shouldn't tell you this...
excuse me.
but there are so many of them. do you know each one separately.
and how could you fucking leave horrace hanging?
it's the transponder.
and if they've got dr. loveless building weapons like those flying bombs... they just might do it.
yeah, mine too.  is it like, y'know, normal?
uh huh.
the architecture exhibit! my friend tucker is going to be here. he's an architect, too. you guys will have tons to talk about.
who?
they're not going to hurt you. they're encased in plastic.
you still think he's in there?
we're gonna get caught. i know we're gonna get caught. they were eyeballing my car.
i don't think so.
chosen me?
for reminding me, i mean. can you follow me?
she's dead.  she's gone.  and now you're just gonna go away and never come back, too.  i hate this place; it isn't fair.
you should knock.
yeah.  another little matter needs attending to soon as i return.
we'll go to the zoo sometime. okay? i think i might have some time on my hands.
no.
we can probably get some first aid and food at this gas station up here.
-- instead of just waiting for their turn to speak.
i was all of these.
dr. satan?
i promise.
right here, woody!
eh, joey, even you don't know what you meant. you mentioned salvy, tommy como, you -- that means somethin'. why'd you say them? you coulda said anybody.
i know. it's like coming from the moon. or mars.
i wanted to save geordi. i tried. but i experienced something i did not expect.  i believe it was fear.
more to the point, why am i here? what did you want with me?  what does one say to one's maker, having finally met him face to face? milton gave it voice.  did i request thee, maker, from my clay to mould me man? did i solicit thee from darkness to promote me?
we're not running a dating service here.
slut.
you don't really believe it's haunted... do you believe in ghosts?
for what they done? skinny gets some ponies an' that's...?
don't you fucking but me, jerry.  i want you with this money on the dayton- radisson parking ramp, top level, thirty minutes, and we'll wrap this up.
even after a little vacation, they hassled him at the airport.
now betty, don't overreact.
sweltering.  come on, i'll take you home.
we're going for a little liquid refreshment.
i don't have much experience with a...uh...stick.
of course.
your guess is as good as mine.
good morning, quince.
they're... around.
friend of yours? did you help him out of a bind?
know what i'm going to buy with my first pay check?
checking my pulse. it's elevated.  you enjoy frightening me, don't you?
it's simple. i like what i do -- i enjoy doing it. there aren't many men who love their work as much as i do. look around some time.
energy shielding positive function.
what's happened is freak luck.
for what?
i've been here. what day is it?
that would be a pity.  those words might show you something you've never seen before.
no.
let's get something straight. you don't know me. i don't know you. but i know what you're about.  keep your distance from this house -- and from jamie.
what kind of good memories, max? your mother and father fighting all the time.
sorry.
i'm not crazy.  i know the difference between right and wrong.
you don't ever think about other people?
what kind of trouble are you in?
his word.
part of what?
even those delicate veins, the texture of this flesh -- i have never seen anything more exquisite.
no, but... i don't know... sometimes.
what makes you think you're so almighty? telling people what to do and how to act when you don't even know how yourself.
sporting events, yeah.
why?  nobody's there.
packed.
he was working on something called project manticore, which was using recombinant dna to produce a superior human...a warrior...an advanced infantry soldier.
stay away from my thang.  sorry, honey.  'thing.'
that's what i have to believe...
she's getting steamed 'cause i'm still re-channeling my sexual energy--maybe i should cave in and sleep with her once just to calm her down.  what'ya think?
no. it's all about that night, isn't it?
he leads, i follow.
i don't trust that chatterbox.
oh no, you were too busy trying to keep some croatian from slapping the shit out of his girlfriend. she showed her gratitude by almost taking your eye out with her spiked heel.
no.  they make me sick.  they smell like death ... i had two brothers die young.  but let me tell you, there are worse things than death.  there is such a thing as evil.
when one approaches fifty, my dear, he is affected only by the cold.
graham, i swear to christ i'll kill your scrawny ass. now give me those tapes.
don't you think it's sort of a waste for the two of us to...
well, we met about three months ago. he works at the surgeon general office. he loves boating.  so, he's been getting me into water skiing.
you gotta idea, spit it out.
yeah, no more ninety-minute deliveries around the corner.
must you fight him?
will you shut up and play.
they never found dad's body--maybe somehow--
we couldn't be on more solid ground.
couldn't you have moved in with your mom?
all right, but you're missing out. chicks with dicks.
a rough estimate.
pullin' ah pants down...
no. can i move now?
the moon?
you know nothing of power, you foolish girl. you think power is a mighty sword, or a strong castle, or the paltry magic of an emerald seer. power is none of these.
good.
eric...you can't be like me. you have to be better. i'm not the guy you think i am...
funny how so many people wanna buy carpet on a friday night.  you'd almost think they's want to forget about it for the weekend.
yeah? where?
least you can leave.
go down in my room.
don't "come on, dignan" me.
not so fast, mrs. buckley. that was your idea!
where did you say she's from?
yeah--thousands, and right in my back yard.
oh, i'm very grateful.
you don't have to remember to be hungry.
i'm taking you back.
it's not myself i'm worried about.
why?
no, thomas. i don't know how to sign.
hello.
who told you?
i don't know megan.
just help.
no. i'm a gardener.
that's what i get for dressing in a hurry.
is this neighborly life insurance?
and... do whatever it is you do.
oh.  excuse me.
what are you?
oh. uh... 'hey, you! get your damn hands off her!'  george paused. you really think i should swear?
i killed her!
he told me. besides, why else would an a.t.f. man be after him?
hear, hear!
it is day, of course, freya.
too bad you're out of it.
knowing i have to die...
so mr. mcallister asked you to run.
i got in trouble at school.
what happened to me?
i told him i was mrs sam rothstein.
yeah.  how long have you been here?
must not've been the captain's entry. he was probably out of the picture by then.
you stop it.  you're loving, and gentel..  you're the most remarkable woman i've ever met --- so stop telling me i don't know what i feel just cause you're scared.  cause it won't work.
for christ sake, i said it, i didn't do it.  besides, i don't think they were too offended, do you?
your records are older than you are.  have you never heard of new wave?
uh, it's ok, everything's going to be ok...now i'm counting on you, and whatever you do keep calm, we don't want them to panic.
i'd never do that.
i understand completely.
those aren't real memories. no one has that kind of recall.
i don't know it was stolen until i got here.
you've broken its leg!
why didn't you say something?
you're welcome, grace.
how is everything?
no, no, no
yeah.  so you can call me if you need help.
my lord.
i ain't waitin', bill.  i'll look in on your youngsters when i get back.
...i can't wait to be among you.
haven't seen her - not since we got back.
mercy... is to die quickly. perhaps even live in the tower. in time, who knows what can happen, if you can only live.
this is it.
surest thing you know.
are you married?
david, let's go now.
then i'll leave thee.
and baron, thanks so much for everything.
you think i don't hear things?
buff, that slice is the difference between life and death for some half-dead bangladeshi.
finish the fucking story! what happened?! what about the glands?
yamaha white.  nice.
you don't have to explain. did i tell you how grateful i am for what you've done?
yeah, but... you know what i mean.
you know them personally?
thank you.
he's dead.  whatever i may or may not feel means exceedingly little to him now.
holly. holly! please... the other sandman. remember the one who came after --
and his soul black as the ace of spades.
nah, some guy threw me a few bucks to track down his high school girlfriend.
no.
that's easy.  you...
...huh?
well, i... uh...
no.
certainly, herr director.
for the best. exactly. i wouldn't want things to end on a downer.
they're here!  they're inside the house -- !
ww... uh...
millions - if anybody wants it.
i'm not ready for marriage.
some spot you pick.
he wants to kill you, you know... perhaps i won't allow it.
i'm making my turn.  i see the school up ahead.
"well done," cactus.
quiet!
check your data banks for all the information you have on imperial procedures.  both of you will have to learn...
don't worry about me, jerkoff.
okay, okay.  you join him.  but first will you ask if he's here?
you must sit with us, my friend, we have much to discuss.
ring the call to quorum.
i'm talking about this thing you have... this inability to improve your situation in life.
thomas?
i don't know why i come here every evening, it's always such bad news.
a great deal.  they designed and build tiger's chariot...
you don't want this.
hey, guess who's here? it's that chick from inside story?
you don't mean that.
people beat it, don't they?  all the time.
you'd drifted right through the core systems.  it's blind luck that deep-salvage team caught you when they...are you all right?
we commend the soul of our brother departed. we love we commit his body to the depths of space.
whoa...whoa...wait, wait -- don't please....
yep.  he really crushed that dinger, didn't he.  musta gone 450 feet...damn...
--melodramatic?  things are past that--remember, these are men with switchblade mentalities who run the world as if it were dodge city.
you must listen carefully:  the fire department will be here soon. there is an injured man in the alley who needs assistance.  as shelly webster once needed your assistance, and as you are shortly going to need my assistance.
and you should be with your family.
and now?
you?
what?
there's something very familiar about this painting.
got any ideas, little brother?
what's this all about, lad?
never.
yeah. marvin's old man gunned him down.
i'm glad. but what's all this?
that's why a.t.f.'s gotta make the case. i'm their witness. they wouldn't have a case without me. if it's his word against mine, who are they gonna believe?
boy, i bet i know who's workin' late tonight.
if you're trying to push my buttons, you're on the right track. don't make me question my own judgment, x.
oh yeah. it's herschel gordon lewis. he's the ultimate master of horror.
the police are waiting for you up ahead. there's a roadblock. you have to go back.
can i trust you, sami?
frock's been fired.
dewey, what the hell is she rambling about now? what's wrong jen, see yourself on one of those usa network winners you did and realize how badly you suck at acting?
gee. i'm sorry to hear that.
what is that old building?
no you don't know who stole it. just let me do the thinking.
sorry.  it's the first time i've ridden "piggy-back" in years.
what does that have to do with it? she don't look 15 to me. i heard somethin' with salvy. she was with him once or somethin', i think. it was like some blonde. that's the one...
you have the money?
i'm telling you it's not that.
no, it's the recipe for spaghetti "frutti del mare".  you see i was right in getting you out here.  you're a world champion, my friend!
then put your goddam drawers on, and get your ass out here. i got somethin' to show you.
i don't know no gibson. this is a restaurant. many people come here.
they stole the phones.  they stole the leads.  they're...christ.  what am i going to do this month? oh, shit... 
greenpeace?
no cops.  i've got a warrant out. mail fraud.  they'll take me in, but you won't be able to prove anything else.
why?
what's he got that i haven't got?
after a ways.
well, he owns things.
use your grenades! maybe we can blow it up underwater!
what chu listening to rumors for? i'm not like dat.
this is it.
yeah.
i can...make it work.
sorry?!
she give you that scar, too?
rick, that is the first time i have ever seen you so impressed.
i can't go out there. how can i go out there?
how do you know i will?
forget i said wife.
you need a reason, frank. you don't just go around breaking people's windows. that's anarchy.
he's not getting a phone, he doesn't like talking on the phone.
merci. i... do you... would you like to go get a cup of coffee, perhaps?
then why did you give him a beatin' if he didn't do anything? you and him been friends a long time.
i'm getting better!
come up here a minute.
i can see that.  i know things look pretty bleak right now, but you can't get down on yourself.
i thought you'd never ask. the older one is janet, she's nine, and the younger one is morgan.
i was the world's sweetest ingenue.
it got lonely upstairs. there's someone on the roof.
because i'd met someone else.
i suppose computers have been known to be wrong.
jody, you have to go to the party. for your own safety.
thank you.
his wife?
rebecca lawson.
i'm sorry. that was unkind and -- but, we changed our minds.  did you really mean what you said on the phone. it wasn't because you found out about rex?
are you saying accepting your help obligates me!?
what's wrong with it?
how's it going?
oooh, ba-by!
but so is vond-el
he's on duty.
i'll be ready.
jim miller and suzy donaldson never showed up. i'm a little concerned.
where is your luggage?
don't run away - i was always the man for you!  i'm talking to you out of two years of silence - listen to what i say!  inside of six months -
oh my god.  oh my god.
sure, i've done it easily.
i was appalled, just as you are now.
honey.  nothing's impossible.  you just don't shoot someone like that for no reason.  maybe he was askin' for it.  anyway, somebody's husband probably got ol' harlan.
it's twitching but it's below the line you said was safe.
they're jealous.
depends who it's from.
animals involved? i know, but you need a change. and besides, we're short.
you little liar! get out of here!
you know all that “if these walls could talk” stuff? do you believe it? that a place has a memory?
i thought you were sixteen.
i couldn't help it, snake. i had to shoot you. cuervo made me do it, i swear to god, man.
what?
the thing is, i'll need a first mate.
thanks.
no.
how many planes did we lose?
you from around here?
yahoo !!!!!
well, nothing we can do about it. come into my house. you can stay with me, until i build you your own place. i expect you won't want to mix with the others-- not our type of people.
do you want me to come with you sid? i mean, remember what randy said?
sam! hey podner! you caught me playing hooky--
a springbok, an oryx, a gemsbok--a gazelle.
you'll never understand. me and you, wayne, we're not even the same species. i used to be you...then i evolved. from where you're standing, you're a man. from where i'm standing, you're a ape. i'm here...i'm right here... and you...you're somewhere else, man. you say why? i say why not?
maternity ward, huhh!
no, it's not. i thought i was done waiting for reed... we're all in this together now, ben.
why?
she's got an army of people to get her up and out.
okay! it's under my desk!!  taped to the bottom side!!!
well, when i walked up the block, i ... well, my word!
flagged books cover every topic the bureau deems questionable... communism to violent crime.
and then they'll kill 'em.
uh-huh.
listen, pal—this fifth column stuff's pretty rotten, isn't it?[11]
yes, sir.  don't worry.  we handle this kind of thing all the time.
twenty-five-million!  and what will they do if the money isn't delivered?
what?
he set things right with a proper apology... and now they've put him in charge of dissection lab!
wrong! i was willing to do whatever it took to get you up off your ass and on the way to california... there's a big difference.
why are you telling him that.  are you crazy?
i thought people just wanted their mail delivered on time.
i'm telling him in the morning after breakfast.
n...nothing.
what's this sauce!  i'm lactose intolerant.
are you sure?
yes i can transmit the code 3 emergency!  i just don't think it's a prudent move at this juncture.
you better run out to the house. she may be... unable to answer the phone...
peter, what about the bathtub?
i apologize for the inconvenience.
nothing.
sometimes when she talks that way to me i'd like to... curse her out and leave her forever!  or at least, defy her.  but i couldn't. she's ill.
hundreds of times.
no, it's not.
did an exploratory and according to them, she needed an overhaul.
do we have any idea how many borg we're dealing with?
i already told you you were gonna get lucky, jack...
oh, you mean--puss in boots.
perhaps.
yeah.
this isn't permanent, johnny.  we need to be careful until we're normal again.
mom, stop with this already. of course i love you. you're my mother.
everything's okay? 
how was your game?
it's just more than anybody else does around here.
you are married, correct?
yes.
we'll get it, and if we can't, we'll just make it up.  grand larceny, extortion.  counterfeiting, anything you want.
we have a search warrant, mr. wigand. there's been a death threat.
do me a favour. you don't really expect me to fix kinnear on your say-so?  just because they tried to get me on you last night, don't think you can pull the same trick. stroll on.
simple-icity is more like it. and you guys thought jam was in trouble before. wait till mrs. bruce finds out he went to that concert with us.
he has come for lyssa.
... the smell of victory, jeanne! mmmmmmm!  i love it!
well, riddle me this, batman. how do you feel about the fact that you're never gonna see mallory again?
don't sweat it. now i got an l.a. gun story. you should hear the way i tell to the guys back home. he had an uzi. mike half-smiles.
fuckin' a, man.  i got a rash. fuckin' a, man.  i gotta tell ya tony.
nah, we make out and stuff.
if he does our job, he's our job.
...a little. i was a little tipsy. don't call me pathetic.
how do you know she did that?
hey, you been sneaking some reading outside the frigging bible!
why not? don't you love artie?
what about you?
i have to ask you that. if you were vice you couldn't deny it. you ought to dress less square. you wouldn't get hassled so much. here, let me help you get that tie off.
it's freakish.  i don't get it.  i'm not really supposed to touch you, but i can look.
roman that's not the line.
i do.
then stop talking and work faster!
chris, what if i were to cut you in as partner in this project - together we could make it swing, all it needs is a good clean out and the power on, then we're in business.
he's great. come on, let's blow before lo' gran decides to boil your bones for breakfast.
too many men have died at its edge. it only looks pure because blood washes so easily from its blade.
she's gonna need to know that her little girl's alright.
chief, here's a little secret. drink heavily, your feet will know what to do. now shit or get off the pot. do you wanna dance or do you wanna see kiss only on their album covers?
all right. get him.
let it go.
well. once he said he'd read what this man wrote about me.
well daddy and i are just friends now, and that's no reason not to wear mascara...
what do you do?
oh, no!
if you don't stop, i'm going to kill you.
all right, tom -- it's true. i know it's true.
honey?
how's that about your being my friend?
lapd. open the door.
what?
wait - are you accusing me? you're not serious.  i can't... mr. mcallister, we have worked together on sga for three solid years and... i mean, i can't believe it. i'm... i'm shocked!
what is it we can do for you today?
any others?
insurance policy.  now this is going to sting a bit, but it's for your own growth, brah.  press play.
:the night in the woods with his father and sounder. the shouting and laughter after the baseball game --
okay. okay.  here's what you do.
don't you want to know what happened to me?
how in the devil did you do the rembrandt then?
what's the bad news?
no, uncle, and now i'm pleased to have been able to do this favor, because, although i didn't think so at first, you are really a good man.
then what do you need me for?
that would fit.  it's nocturnal. quick.  come inside.
lydia.  lydia what?
you know that great thing, though?  is that change can be so constant you don't even feel the difference until there is one.  it can be so slow that you don't even notice that your life is better or worse, until it is.  or it can just blow you away.  make you something different in an instant.  it happened to me.
i see.
it's a present from my parents.
dirty night.
i wanted them to fly down some orchids from our greenhouse but all of long island is fogged in.
we should leave too.
kobayashi.
so long.
oh, i suppose you could do better.
our numbers are through the roof. the ipo's tracking at fifty, sixty a share. the bank's five times oversubscribed --
yes, but...
there was a transfer.
he was a pirate who sailed these waters long ago. his name is bein' borrowed these days by the long lost henry dickerson.
you're beautiful what you're jealous, you know that, joey?
i'll go. -- i love you.  i'll be on that train. i'll get the money.
i fear our meeting is long overdue... napoleon.
but what'll i do?  what'll i say?  what'll i wear?
i just have time to get the, uh-
big guy -- goes to barrington high school.
oh, some shit.
people just...disappear.
you think they're still up there?
prolonged darkness makes people crazy.
rallying cry, it's an insurrection. seale, that god damned cleaver, where the hell do these guys come from?
and fifty other lines to get into a girl's pants.
think.
i want to go home. i want off this ship.
let me tell you a few things about you dad, okay? he's very very very clever, very very brave, and he loves you ever very much.
well, let's go talk to your doctor.
i'm going to convert mr. science-is- the-root-of-all-evil?  this is absurd, david.  we have work to do here, i don't have time to play babysitter to the god squad.
advocaat is it?
nothing.
sorry. why are you dressed like a queen!?
what class sub does your nephew run?
i ain't interested in his mental condition. all i want to know is, is he d 'n d or is he a canary?
not yet.  i had a phlemless morning.  i hear he's a pretty good ballplayer.
he asked for will. he said he might call back tonight. i tried to hold him... i'm sorry... he said 'tell graham "broken mirrors."'
you could say that.
listen to me, grady, this is serious. something really weird is happening.  it started out like just bad dreams but it's getting real bad.
what you want with her anyway'
hell no, i can't do that myself. i'm blind.  can't you see that?
i won't be making the trip.
why would you care?
mrs. robinson, you stand there and tell me i'm not good enough for your daughter.
yes.
why does anyone want to be in movies?
what worries me is that jesus is talking back.
fuck the community.  there was this article my friends and i read. it was "25 signs he's great in bed". it was very fascinating.
why—
music, of course. to get a sweetheart, one has to look around, but to get a radio, all you have to do is buy one.
besides, if we get a lot of work done this summer it'll be done.
belief is immaterial.  what's important is the truth... it's been my job to find jerry.  i'm very much responsible for him.
for bravery.
this isn't possible...
--we could bum around the world for a year on that.
i...
why didn't he just go public with the tape?  save himself that way.
there anytime you don't got a mouthful of shit?
you mean they knew who i was?
thank you, roger.
how could i forget?
i don't know. i'm pretty familiar with the school and i've never seen that "x". but... i do know something.
-- here we go -- i found it --
you want to go out there --  get out of this for a second?
i know.
i don't consider uncontrollable toxic waste progress!
yeah, well fuck you, she's a priority to me!
hey, mickey.
thanks, doc, but i don't need an aids test. are you crazy? but thanks for the information. really.
where?
you know, you ever think about other women?
y'all getting any rain up your way?
took you long enough.
why not then?
are those the only two possibilities?  you wanna french fry?
wha-chu-say, palequero? short time, long time, only ten dolla.
i got married before, you didn't sell.
naw, he picked up some jane in the bar.  can't see him till morning anyway.
you want a beer, ang'?
there it is. better swallow it. we're not going to have any breakfast.
vincent.  it was nice to meet you. visit again?
he was drunk that night. he left his coat at your house, after your mother seduced him...
they are?
just relax. have you hit the cash machine?
bit expensive, sir.
i told you, they hired me over the phone.  i never met anyone.
maybe... i don't know... but first we have to confess...
and you know they're gonna have some people watching the hotel.
we're not finished.
come on!
i tremble with fear! you're bound to pound the quivering lips of my venus mound!
give me twenty minutes.
that's true. oh, god, lotte, what have i become? my wife in a cage with a monkey. a gun in my hand. betrayal in my heart.
otis went on like you were that guy who won the gulf war. colin whatsit.
to code?
barnes wouldn't kill two innocent guards.
not my wife - not either of them.
that's true.  you grow up here?
no, madame, it's the way you <u>follow</u>.
obviously i was wrong!
the sheriff says it was a gang of drunk kansas boys.
her name's libbets.
do you feel good about it?
no accident.  i tried to warn all of you about krueger.
look, jerry - take my advice - forget the whole thing - just keep telling yourself you're a boy!
i guess it isn't.
i like you.
you had to kill heller?!
sister, if i knew the answer to that i sure as hell wouldn't be here.
did you make the plate?!
i don't think the fire people can touch him out there.
i want to cut his throat.
you go to the council fire. i'm going back in.
i'm sorry, mr. white, but i've got an errand to run.
right. you can't sleep here.
the average first offender gets two years for burglary. we were all first offenders. that's what sophia and peg drew --
i just want to see what we're like together through your eyes.
...yes, sir.
son of a bitchin' lowlife, putrid, scum...
what about it, diz ?
<u>here</u>?!
fuck bastaldi and his brother. these tapes are gold. do you have any idea what zammito would pay to get them back?
don't do anything stupid, cotton. you've come to far.
you're smarter than kobo.  you know the price of deceit.  think about it.
we're seeing all the signs in town.
no, i understand.
why not?
we hung out last night, remember?
you mean to tell me you're not going to do anything until we land?
to the stars.
okay.
he said that?
fact of the matter, muley, after what them dusters done to the land, the tenant system don't work no more. it don't even break even, much less show a profit. one man on a tractor can handle twelve or fourteen of these places. you just pay him a wage and take *all* the crop.
there !	gravity field... it's big !
there was an inquiry.  it was his word against mine.  they believed him.  i was fired.
the prison board made the decision. a board of which i belong. we're the who. the why is simple. mickey and mallory are mentally ill and need to be under a doctor's care, where hopefully they'll receive the help they need.
maybe because they never do.  so don juan, you pass out on all your dates?
what is it?
hard to tell. looks like he's been cleaned up and he's decomposing as we speak. this case gets weirder by the minute.
i don't know...
diane!
he's a lame dog, remember?  but even he wouldn't want to see you like this.
i promise not to bring any more venuses and not to worry - and not to try to get in touch with any of the papers -
i'm er ... sorry if you've been waiting a long time.
no again?
i gave him the impression that there was a fly crawling up my mom's leg. he is going to go eat it.
j.c. penney. beauty and fragrances.
it's taken on a disguise.
it was his body that was buried there.
i steady it out, they blow us out of the sand!
for what? breaking my heart or ruining sex for me with any other man?
oh.
i thought it would be good to know.
maybe we should get a pimp. carlos likes you and --
what rumors might those be?
how soon can we get up and running?
you just got here....
[beat] yeah, it is.
fame?  thank you, no. fame is the burial ground of contentment. eat it and go hungry; count it and go broke; seek it and grow mad. fame is what fools yearn for and wise men shun.
wait a second.  we can't go in like this.  look at this place, we gotta look fly.  we gotta mac out.
how often do you use cocaine?
well i didn't know about you until after she was gone.
what hurts vada?
you must know your third grade geography book inside out.
lighten up, wahine.
captain who?
are you sure?
public display of affection. every time he moves up a rank, it's like he's got to tighten the screws a little more--
will you stop it! sorry to disturb you, miss...
has it got a wow finish?
yes. he traced her to that motel, out on the old highway...
for the very first time in my life.  do you know what that's like?
i don't know. what do you feel like doing?
come on--  i'll promote a card game, and we'll be sitting pretty.
ten o'clock tomorrow morning. i'll be there.
if we could scare up some men to play.
don't make an issue of my womanhood. we are here for work... all of us. let's not waste time. shall we go?
yes, finally.

eighteen thousand feet, sir. and two hundred knots... otherwise it's suicide.
no, no ... not "is"!
the land has stayed in the family. we work together. the nobleman is not too bad.
yeah, sure.  more so then than i am now.  that's life though, isn't it?
oh. well. maybe not yet.
maybe not, but why take chances?
now let's see, two thousand dollars. that isn't much.  i'm sure i can hide it somewhere.  after all, the department of internal revenue isn't interested in a show that flopped.
but you don't have the money?
if you knew how i yearn for that...

i can take care of myself.

...mr. verger would be pleased to make a contribution, to the charitable...
here's yours.
no.  and...
i'll do my best, mary.
but if you just let things alone, we wouldn't lose anyone.
in time. but mirabile dictu, don't you agree?
they think we like it.  maybe they think it turns us on.
damn straight!
there won't be any this week.
me too!
this has everything to do with me dewey. i was the one who brought the nation's attention to this shit anyway. i'll be damned if i'm gonna sit around and pass on the buck again.
snuffed her.
oh . . .
fenster and hockney?
you sure? i know my father would hate to be tied down. he wouldn't even go to the dentist.
what kind of a life is that?
'cuz they couldn't hunt shit with these things, be my guess.
an answer.
cotton company --
he better not be. i told stu to keep his mouth shut. i think we can live without everybody's all american for one night.
where's the story? i bluffed it out with a few notions of my own. it's really just a springboard. it needs work.
we're going to do this.
the statue. she had shown it to me the day before.
i don't pretend i came over on the mayflower--
you know what i'm talking about.
up north.
did you bring the cards?
you're lucky, boy.  my house is gonna be filled with people.
what about dr. michaels?
where is everyone? i'll ask --
right here, why not? i prayed in saloons, i prayed in the street, i prayed an the toilet. he don't care where, what he wants is that prayer.
what are you doing? wait a minute. lets think this through.
a natural athlete can play any sport. any sport.
not just today -- uh, could you do it -- until, until he gets back on his feet?
sabotage? i don't understand...
oh really. why's that?
you!
i won't ever hit you.  i don't want you smaller.  i want you to be happy.  you're not.  not here with me. not home with your mother.  not up in tahoe.  not alone.  not anywhere.  you're what i was most of my life, sam. i see it in your eyes.  in your sleep. in your answer to everything.  you're barely alive.
no, no.
maybe now's when you tell me about it.
nothing.
no.
oh - okay, we ain't done with this... those babies are gonna get a good start in life - with a real crib - one that costs a shit-load!  we're gonna learn how to rob a bank from the only people who really know how to do it - criminals!  i'm gonna visit my mom!
what year is it?
a solitary vireo. i like that one.
no, not holding hands.
don't trouble yourself about it, homer--this ain't your business.
i might ask you the same question.
just drive, gregoire.
accident my ass.  i thought this was supposed to be straight talk in here.
no.  course not.
what about her?
but i feel like maybe i could be really comfortable with you.
i shall wear it in my hair!
that strange things.. terrible things have occured around this american, kurtz.
anyway, i had lou read your script for me.
no no no no no no no no no find me the money...
what i'm saying is <u>if</u> it's a crocodile that cut a man in half he would have to be over twenty feet which would make him well over a hundred years old, it would be unthinkable to destroy him.
i can't imagine that sweet girl with that dear face --
well, mademoiselle, he's the kind of a man that, well, if i were a woman and i...  were not around, i should be in love with rick. but what a fool i am talking to a beautiful woman about another man.
why don't you throw them all away, and smoke none?
cut it out. just cut it out, okay? it's starting to get on my nerves.
no, i -- you're a homosexual.
yeah, when do i get my hypnosis? you guys been talkin' for twenty minutes.
in a dictatorship, art belongs to the party. if you want to be a conductor, you have to have an orchestra. and you can only get an orchestra if you have contact with the power. all over the world you need the right contacts and you have to make the right compromises.
well...i know there were some captives recovered...
that's where my best customers are. marion berry, george bush, the redskins. i'd like to offer you a job, cindy. can you type? take dictation? swallow balloons filled with cocaine?
we'll make 'em, and we'll enforce 'em. all of us. together. we all get one vote. includin' me.
got it.
i'm president of the international fletch corporation.
he's not my boyfriend.  i mean, i let him take me out and stuff, but i ain't spoken for.  not yet that is.
there's no other choice.
you betcha.
okay.  i'm sorry, look, i meant to tell you.  it was the only chance i had to meet her.
you were great out there!
they've got my amado.
where up north?
backup man from the east bay. worked with ganz a few years ago and sprung him from the road gang.
mrs. dudley'll be waiting for you.
yes -- yes, they have. it was a real shock at first, especially since my daddy's a preacher, but delbert and i have been blessed by their being here.
bring your rifles, that's all.  take us to him.
who knew she was pregnant?
forgive me, your majesty, i am about to make it.
yup.
what's wrong with your face?
well, that's a funny thing to say.
no you weren't.
your clients were arrested with a walkie-talkie; they didn't need that to talk among themselves.
well, come on in.
you know how i felt about her.
destroy it?
i'm getting a doctor!
far cry from new york.
thanks.
right.  now look: i want you all to be very careful. this is terra incognita. many customs will doubtless take us by surprise. it's a forgone conclusion these people have never seen an extra-terrestrial before.
i lost him - i heard shots - that way!!
well, i want to...
she was there, alone, sir, she was in a burning building, waiting for your folks to come through the wall.  and...
gimmee her number, i'll have her pick you up.
got any ethel merman?
sure.
go power rangers!
it's not really--
huh? sure, look in my closet, take any dress you want!  we're still on for tonight, right?
forgive me for intruding so late at night, herr baron.  but an ugly rumor has it that there are strange goings on in this castle.  these good citizens are ready to rip you from limb to limb unless you can offer some rational explanation for their fears.  how say you?
i ain't ever talked to a movie star before.
the business has changed...
i hope that's the cousin.
i can't -- i won't be able to stop --
ten throws it is.
meanwhile, he might find it.
i'll worry about that. let's get on with it.
eight, almost nine years.
don't you know? everyone on rura penthe is here for life.
new? no. we're hoping we find grant, he'll lead us to her.
maybe she found him like that.
can anybody hear me!
i'm going to the chinks.  you're done, come down, we're going to smoke a cigarette.
i've...look.  will someone get this guy off my back.
you're planning a trip?
oh, no, that's the style. it's meant to be clinging.
you weren't at harrison's department store the night before--
you know... we've been going together for a week and a half...
read me what she said.
please, hurry...
what's that supposed to mean?
i waited... i would have fucking waited...
i'm glad of it, honey.
how'm i s'posed to ever sleep there again knowing some pervo's probably touched everything i own?
you' new here, man!  see you, boys.
you think....there could've been something up in those woods that anna--
listen very carefully, i'm telling the truth... this is the game.  this was all the game.
the jockey!
we been seein' you all along the way.
you mustn't talk russian to me.
forty-five.
creasy. just call me creasy.
yes it is ... may i introduce you to bern ...
i didn't check my messages...
oh ... hi.
have to talk about something.
nothing... she grabbed me, and then there was an image on the screen...
unless you get caught.
wait a minute. answer my question. was mrs. dickson there?
oh, just like in the script!
what guarantees can i give you?  i am the hunted one.  i've missed my chance.  you think too highly of me, my friend...i am not so clever...all i want if a truce...
--they're worse. that's why i quit.
unka unka unka unka unka.
anywhere but here.  i'd just sit here and cry about the way my father's been forgotten.
i'm not on the phone to talk to you about that.  well, i don't know what to say, leon.  when you gimme that... when you hit me with that shit.  i mean, what am i supposed to say?
uh huh.  you might recognize the names.  quite a few of them worked at gila flats.
rayford!
hurry up, would you?
i'm so sorry to trouble you, but-
you know, nothing special.
do you really think your life is meaningless, eleanor?  is that why you're so quick to risk it -- because if your life means nothing then you have nothing to lose?
when my name makes them cry in their sleep. when i've brought them to ashes.
mission district.  gonna find us an indian.
then you'll have to kill me before it's too late.  before i start killing people.
it's questionable whether there's any advantage to be had from that direction.  she's never been less popular.
no. but that's why we hated him. we admired him as a conductor but we all hated him too because he didn't have to join the party and yet he had a better life than any of us. he didn't have to go and deliver a report after every trip abroad. he got everything from them, everything. he was filthier than any of us party members.
i turned houstan down; i didn't see why i should tell you about an offer i turned down.  are you sure, mikey?  are you sure of what we're doing; what we'll gain; what does the family gain? forget that, mike; i already know the answer.
objection.  your honor, we don't know where this tape is from.  who made it -- or under what circumstances it was made.
what do you want me to say?
you're thinking about killing him.  i can't do that.  no way.  i've never killed a man.  never even shot at one...
can i ask you a question?
i don't know.
don't know if god wanna see me.
i gave up my soul, my beliefs. i gave up my body hair!
don't let yourself get killed, if you do, they might make me give back the medal and then i won't be able to lip off to colonels anymore.
not anything, bill. don't test me.
bob. i didn't...
i swear... this is the place swann told me about.  the rocks...
the workers don't get on?
"mumford"... i mean, why pick the name of the town you were going to?
boy.
huh?
no, he tossed the wallet, but he kept the license.
no.
she wouldn't...
oh, but it is.  he's killing a person everyday and challenging us to catch him.  that's a game.  it has rules and objectives.
not this time.
look, we're not suckers. everyone else is out there doing the same thing.
because the sky is so clear out here.
yeah.  but it's going to get loud again.
i guess you could call it a hobby. it doesn't take me more than about five minutes a day to do it, but i do it every day. rain or shine, sleet or snow. sort of like the postman.  sometimes it feels like my hobby is my real job, and my job is just a way to support my hobby.
you made it possible for us to get away at a few hours' notice--you never asked why, but i guess you know.
what have you prayed for?
when it gets to seventy-five below, stabilize it.
jesus, i don't know. you tell me. you're the indian.
figures.
looking for the fossils.  why should we wait until we're in london?  this girl was probably twelve years old.
because they deserve to, walter.
you aim a gun at me?!  do you know who i am?!  i am gino marzzone.  you understand?
mop rags --!
i'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. for the rummage sale. and some things for the cleaners. and the laundromat.
those are feds.
what boy likes you?
such as?
you're going back?
kirsty?
what'd you get?
i do.  i do.  in my own way.
the what?  but you are tired and you must rest awhile.  midget! crapper!
yeah? like ralph lauren?
what's going on?
i said: are you sure? you seem unsure.
he amputated his own leg?
-and babcock, i remember. now go on!
this wasn't my idea.
what is that?  you drop your dive light?
that's not what i'm asking for. i want somebody who can find out what philip saw in those damn cards. and stop it from happening.
yes.
glenmorangie is very good.
we've met before.
not necessarily.  he could go off road at any number of places.  he might not even be in the country anymore.
hey, hey -- there's a rent.
a check?
no shit?
course i have.
about six years. my partner took me.
i ought to know.
well, you don't have to get snippy with me.
i'll tell him. where does he live. we'll get him on the phone right now.
that's fine, bela.  we're still rolling.  just say "dear, you're lovely."
almost.
black, black...
you got a nasty side to your thought process.
there's a lot i haven't done with a man before.
and what're you whispering for?
where are our kids? has he got one of them in there?
i am... on gina.  fuck – i didn't think we were actually gonna do this.
don't you like this?
last week? when?
yeah, i guess, but - and here's the lesson part - they ain't supposed to be so bad for you.
come on.
i'll find something else.  see you in court some day.
after you, doll.
of course you are.
they'll know. they'll know as soon as they born. cause it's inside us,stamp. it'll be inside them. we'll pass it down. schoolteacher didn't just change the outside, he changed the mind..and the blood..and what it carries...and what it's worth..
it's alright janet.  everything's going to be alright.
i got pain an' experience too.
perfect, cole.
what's the matter -- ?
goodnight, rocky.
in three days, darling, i hope.
what a terrible thing to say. how could you even think that?
...what am i going to do all month...
you talk as if i were asta.
this is lena.
used to.
nothing.
i will not betray you, nathanael.
oh yeah.
the important thing is that we have a winner...
you can buy new ones tomorrow.
i'm not playing around. i forgot.
okay, tracy, so who do you think did it?  whom should we "interrogate?"
i have about fifteen hundred 78s at this point. i've tried to pare down my collection to the essential...
georgia.
yes. infinitely more. they would become as god.
pete, the personal rancor reflected in that remark i don't intend to dignify with comment, but i would like to address your general attitude of hopeless negativism. consider the lilies a the goddamn field, or-hell!- take a look at delmar here as your paradigm a hope.
no.  i'd have liked to.
i've done that before.
no.
"the fault, dear david, is not in ourselves but in our stars."
well, you'll take care of her. after all, if that doctor's right, i'm going to live for a long time yet. look, bruce, this is a debt of honor. i was a very bad husband: hildy could have got a lot of alimony if she'd wanted to, but she wouldn't take any. she had it coming to her, but she was too independent.
goodbye.
you're not reman.
l-lies... at first. about how you was just passin' through and didn't kill nobody... an' little bill kept askin' questions, mixin' him up, catchin' lies... an' then he'd beat on ned an' ned would cry and lie some more an' then... then...
here...
jeff. jeff.
i wouldn't be caught dead in that.
engine room, what happened?
hong kong midnight, happy new year. except at china bank.
what i think is going on with your son.
positano is beautiful. remember when we were there, rex? we stayed in the santo pietro? that hotel on the cliff?
wake up! stop playing with yourself. it's finished.
that's correct.
you don't understand, sir, we can't get the bomb to drop.
yeah, good luck. i mean what the fuck. the guy had no legs.
mister welles. you're very prompt.
she fucked us both.
i also called unsolved mysteries.
i don't know...
they say you're in debt.
that doesn't sound dark.
'course i'm respectable. i'm old. politicians, ugly buildings and whores all get respectable if they last long enough. i'll double whatever your fees are and i'll pay you ten thousand dollars if you can find hollis' girlfriend.
i'm home from school. my father's in the hospital.
i would've went to big choice, but the tape i want is right there on the wall.
get on your feet, boy.
oh, all right! well...martin says...
rutherford auction... that name...
a sad choice.
the only faster way up is the east face and it's smooth as glass.  maybe a dozen guys in the world could do it in good weather, only a psycho would try it in a storm.
no, no trouble.  there's other work to do.
she did?
50 k don't get you to first base in the big apple, dad, not any more. i pay 40% in taxes, i got a rent of 15,000, i got school loans, car loans, food, park my car costs me 3 bills a month, i need good suits, that's $500 a pop, shoes...
i don't see how.  you weren't around when i was stuffed and sewn together, were you?
it's the truth.
someone who knows how to clean knows where the object was before she started cleaning and then that object goes back to its exact same spot. shelly, i know where everything in this house is. sometimes on the road i mentally go through this whole house and picture where every item is.
what did you just say?
very good, mrs. peel ...
do you have that?
what?
christ, jack, it's her birthday.
alright.
oh ...  thank you very much, mother, but actually -
you don't win by playing it safe, peter.
we heard you scream. any idea what you might've seen?
but where will you go?  we're in the middle of nowhere.
no joke, cougar. on the level. even i wouldn't do that to you.
it's fenner.
oh, uh...i don't remember too much...
what about the club ... ?
caroline --
she killed herself.  her soul's gonna be in torment.
i know that, lois. and i wish he were here . . .
i'm not.
are you arresting me?
our exec and science officer...
not a chance. it's too nice a night.
huh...?  sure i'm all right...
but this guy you called, he's not even army --
huh? airport or airstrip?
no. no. i heard from superintendent zimmer this morning and evidently he's so impressed with our special needs class, he's bringing richard moffit himself to the thanksgiving day parade- check in hand.
why?
yeah, she's a total loser.  c'mon, let's check out the 7-eleven, whatya say?
shut up a minute and listen.  i'm doing what i can to make this easier for you.
when'd you see him last?
what will we do?
i suppose this is going to sound absurd. i've only known you twenty-four hours, but i'm in love with you.
twenty miles?  i see.
people don't use that word any more.
what's that?
can the kid walk?
my mother used to hum this to me. like her mother hummed it to her. and my great grandmother carolyn hummed it to her.
ebby calvin "nuke" laloosh--
uhura, scan for the whales. 401 megahertz!
the reward.
rose, really, you shouldn't act like that.
only a hummingbird could have caught tyler at work.
where is she?
huh?
it's called journalism, fletch. it's called getting both sides of the story. something you apparently don't know anything about.
new york's finest.
yes, sir.  do you want the other cauliflower?
are you well?
she wants to inspect you. at greenwich, come sunday. be submissive, modest, grateful and brief.
i caught your show down at the velvet room at the holiday inn, loved it when you busted into viva las vegas.
i wasn't part of that picture at all, was i?  i wasn't part of that decision.  did i occur to you at all?  it's a fucking farce.  it's a fucking farce.  how long did you think you could keep it going. you're amazing.  do you have any idea what you've done to us?
i didn't mean that, in life.
through his ass.  next time you see him, tell him to call me... unless you want us to keep coming back on you like a bad case of herpes.
like a nylon lemon peel-
happy as hogs in a waller down there, prob'ly.
what in the hell do you think i'm doing? taking out her tonsils?
hurry, the woman needs help!
he's better off this way.
why do you come to me?  why do i deserve your generosity?
kramer...there's something i ought to tell you.
well, gentlemen, how about my proposition?
oh, she'd quickly revert in her appearance to her actual age.
warm water, no doubt.
-- then i guess then it had to be you. sorry.
what is that, mr. bones?[7]
for the last time, i have no idea what you're talking about --
please... kill...
the sensitive type.
good.  i'll see you when you close, then. enjoy the lasagne.
well...
nothing...
dig the square wardrobe!
you admit the sign did say "camp forest green," with an arrow pointing this way.
hey, terry, i'm hit.
my pleasure.
yes it is...
could you, like, tell her we're ready to score?
don't worry, mom. just go, you'll miss your flight.
so much the better.
yeah...
what else?
you don't have to be unfriendly.
why?  you going to give me hard time like the others?
look sean, i don't care if you have a rapport with the boy-- i don't care if you have a few laughs-- even at my expense! but don't you dare undermine what i'm trying to do here.
magic
you told him about us?
absolutely.
-- kurt's reopening all the wyfi and sat links --
oh, that's very - unusual.
hildy!
we try to be decent.
but you'll never be whole again.
case #1108, previsualized by the precogs and recorded on holoshpere by precrime's q-stacks.  my fellow witnesses for case #1108 are dr. katherine james and chief justice frank pollard.

well, i'm tired. aren't you tired?
just remember: they think there's ten billion dollars in gold down there.
nowhere, mike.  i wanted to get a refill.  how about you?
no.  well, not exactly...it's that...i felt like i wasn't in control.  for the first time since...all that.  i'm scared.
i meant on the post. in general. how are you dealing with it?
all their lines were busy.
oh, for christ's sake.
i skipped. too many "that's her" looks.
my <u>tail</u> itches.
aah!
thanks tom.

who gives a shit about the fucking marmot!
from wickham's. been a while. like some coffee?
if you're not using your arm, can i borrow it?
let's face facts.  this was always a no-go situation.  anna's a goddess and you know what happens to mortals who get involved with the gods.
dad?
fires a burst.  more germans drop.
hello, is this elaine?
-- i paid this fucking guy -- i paid him four thousand dollars -- my last four thousand dollars to marry me, okay? -- i told this to the case officer last week...  ...<u>here</u> -- mr. thomas.  i told mr. thomas i didn't know this guy was already married -- i admitted this!

the guy got sick and couldn't come in.
do you know dr. robert towler...?
man, we totally annihilated his night-stalkin' ass!
what are you going to do about sport and that old bastard?
i'm not convinced you should be happy.

joey ....  look, you wanna ride?  i can go by your place.

and that i can drive a truck!
what about the other kids?  you get anything on them?
the crowd will not disperse until you give your assurance that you will not attend the chinese festivities. many who have been invited to dine with the chinese do not return home.
i suppose that's true in a way. i am fond of you, walter. i often wish you weren't such a stinker.
okay.
if the pig hadn't broke his leg, we could have taken him.

i will. and i choose --
what kind of trouble -- ?
several indiscriminates and one primary who we've id'd as robert dean. a crystal city attorney.  mr. reynolds?  sir?
this is candy.  hang on, let me get some clothes. see!  i don't' understand why i have to start the scene in the shower!  the whole shower things been done, 'vertigo' hello!  and i mean, my boyfriend just died, why am i showering?
the fools! if they only knew it, they're making things worse for themselves. somebody starts a silly rumor, and they lose their heads.
something seems to have happened to my self-respect.
forget it.
a woman.
all right! here's another one. 'the most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first, you climax first, you and your mate climax together?'
i heard something.
eject the core.
i can't let you do this...
got some coffee brewing, huh?
the world is just one kiss-ass game after another.  a man has to make up his own life, alone.
i never *asked* for any responsibility.
not particularly.  jeez, look where this is set! morons.
so suzie and sandra van ryan were half- sisters.
hello, operator? i'm having trouble dialing a number.
tell 'em there's a homicide in progress... cause by the time they show up there will be.
well, you'll not only see those, but before the evening's half through, you'll be leaning against the leaning tower of pisa - you'll mount mt. everest. i'll show you the pyramids and all the little pyramiddes, leaping from sphinx to sphinx. pal, how would you like to go on a real, old-fashioned binge?
you called 911. except the call was intercepted.
stripper?
what's changed, mr. gayle, is our minds. we felt they were competent a year ago. a year has passed, sir, a year where they were under close observation, day in and day out, and their behaviour has led us to believe we were wrong.
it was our idea to take the picture, wasn't it?
hetero.
what?
picture yourself watching marla singer throw herself around her crummy apartment.
by fooling the system.  all someone would have to do is wait for precrime to stop the murder from taking place, then, a few minutes later, commit the crime in exactly the same way.
i got money.
they're none of them right.
as good as humanly possible.
this. my home. my family.  if not for you, i'd be dead in a burial pit somewhere.
stay and listen!  besides, it's twelve in the afternoon. this is no time to go to bed.
i need rice, beans, beer, and your best whiskey.
don't... talk crazy.
yes, some of it is speakable.
i'd go for penetration.  the 458 shooting solids -- less ammo to carry anyway.
you see the lever on the green box? upper right hand corner?
"applicant?"
yeah.
i don't know anymore.
sure -- take him to the vet.
he's my dad.
so, what is it you do, mister...?
what are your plans for the weekend?  hoisting away the colosseum?  tell me, did the devil make you do it or did darwin and minerva mayflower?
what for paul.
you won't have the chance.  any further words of encouragement?  then i've a train to catch.
i'll throw up!
it's an important speech.
right.
well, probably.
name?
oh, that's a phoney.  the men didn't even have to go down.
later.  i'm going out for materiel.  keep this.
no, there's a fourth.  numbness. you do everything right, but you feel nothing either way.
well... the manager, mr. heem, would like to meet him. nothing unusual. mr. heem likes to meet all our large accounts... put them on a personal basis... just a chat and a handshake, you understand.
what am i going to to do with this guy?  pierce, i was just on the phone with borough command. out of twelve shifts this month, you've been late for nine, sick four and that includes the shift where you came late and went home early.
bryant here.  regarding the rundown you requested on job applicants, esper's concluded that the only irregular category that tyrell's got is the entertainment section.  you better get on it.
but i... we don't even know each other.
we had a description of the suspect.
there are ads? for parents?
this is where i proposed.
was i picking on you?  how come you pulled in back of this fruitstand?
is there anybody in the navy you don't know?
i think that's it.
your birth stone.  i thought --
don't worry, i'll straighten all this out.
that's what you said in the last three piss pots.
turn that thing off, will you?  it's driving me nuts!  what's rosebud?
you asked her for her number, and then you tore it up.
oh no -- that would spoil everything. i'll -- i will manage somehow -- i'll manage myself. i will go with you. when does the train leave?
do you study at all?
what'd i say?
there is no dana.  i am zuul.
he trusts you?
yeah, there's room. and there's julia.
pardon?
does he win?
yes, thomas - i understand.
what did your wife get her?
"a mule is an animal with long funny ears."
hey, slow down, turn off the little motor up in there...what do you say we go to the gym and work off a little stress?
i look behind us, i look to the past, to a world steeped in rot and decay.  i think of the acropolis in another century reduced to little more than dust.  i see the faces of rushmore eventually losing all distinction, and then i look at this...
uh, last night...
what'd they ever do for you?
no.
my family expects a lot from me. and i expect a lot from me. i plan on running for office some day.
he's a client of mine! what's the matter. you can't suspect dieter. he's a famous photographer. he makes millions.
to be a hero?
find the money.
a what?
my relationship with god is my own.
twinky?
what are you talking about? you should get a fucking academy award for the shill work you do.  we got it down cold, al. you don't want to jinx it by changing something up, do you?
think i'll have a glass.
an accurate number would be difficult to gauge.
because they said it couldn't be done.
stay put!  i know my way around.
make you a deal.  my brother took over the marshal's office in tombstone.  got it in his head he's gonna make the place safe for widows and orphans.  you and your boys stay out of his way, i'll make sure he stays out of yours.
follow me.
is there a mrs. dyle?
i swear on my life, i won't...
can we talk about this later?  everyone is watching!
i wanted to drive you home. are you all right?
yeah, i got eyes.  i put things together.
do you <u>believe</u>...i have forgotten i am a cop?
and hey, i appreciate it...
you can always he thinner. look...better.
sort of. sometimes. you're not building an obsession about steven, are you? look. i understand opening- night jitters, but you've got one of the great actors in american theater starring in your play.
you hear about your old friend, diego?
don't run, chief.  you know we'll catch you.  you trained us.
david isn't hiding from me, i left him standing at the altar six years ago and now i'm...
knaves and robbers...
what makes you think so?
i'm not dead!
yeah, but how am i gonna get my arm fixed?
just curious.
this is sgt. vincennes. requesting a name and address on a phone number.  hollywood zero-one- two-three-nine.
you have my absolute assurance, your majesty, that napoleon does not have the strength to attack st. petersburg now -- his army is exhausted and ill-supplied, and he would be defeated if he attempted that.
it's shit.
you're a good officer, major mandrake.  you have a right to know.  it looks like we're in a shooting war!
i've heard some odd things about jabez lately -- he seems to make the wrong kind of name for himself.
righteousness for his namesake.
. i saw you come in, talk on the phone. get undressed.

the <u>kobayashi maru</u>, sir.

she's talking to him now.
you threatened miss swann.
so do i just follow you?
xxxxxx
you didn't know as much about this business as you pretended to, did you?
you listen carefully! you ever fuckin' touch her again, you ever do anything like that again, i'll fuckin' kill you.  pure and simple. do you hear me? pure and fuckin' simple, i'll fuckin' kill you, you bitch.
i don't buy them anymore. you were the only one who drank them.
no, really, mate?
what are you talk---
oh, right... they been here since noon. i told them you're real busy.
oh, yah?
go'on and sing it, i'll play.
they're framing me.
listen, it's late already when i realize it's not just a couple of ordinary faggots, it's just you and sal.  i couldn't get a baby sitter.
i don't think so, i think she's confused about death.
go on -- out with you.
your honor: i imagine that, no matter how careful my questioning, mr. ortega would, in his well-intentioned way, dig my client's hole even deeper.
goodbye, mary.
ask them.
what'd you have?
well, i've got to read them first. suppose i could get a coke while i do?
lay them down.
yes. he has a long journey ahead.
look, you don't understand.  i need a job.  i've got a kid and--
...ummm, you really work for the foreign service?
tell dad we're getting married in las vegas.  in one of those chapels.  he can meet us there.
charlie, i feel like i'm going crazy – like i'm losing my mind. i don't know what to do... i didn't do it, believe me. i'm sure of that, charlie. i just...
hey, i tried to get her off the phone.
what about the rest of my comic books?
i'm not sure. i think something is fucked up somewhere in the ship, though.

all right we will.
i repulse you?  very well.  it seems you have chosen your own fate. live with it!  i should say <b>die</b> with it!
i'll be back.
tonight.
i'm here.  i've got a case where they're this close to sequestering the jury but have i answered the goddamn thing?!
...i'm sure you do...
you're full of shit.
you're all right, john you're okay.  it's just you don't have intelligence.  you have "thinktelligence."  you think narrowly and call it "being focused."  you don't see the consequences.  you're very good at solving problems, at getting answers - - but you just don't know the right questions.
yeah, screw 'em, huh? pay 'em to tangle it up and then you pay 'em to untangle it, what's the point?
no, ma. i'm paroled. i got my papers.
that's impossible.
you're making a mistake.  obsolete old carnivores like me are most dangerous when wounded.  you've wounded me.
six ayem.
would you care to explain what you're talking about?
he can imitate anything, you just watch him.
last time you didn't even scratch it!
it's going to get worse, honey.
i don't want you meeting around that house.  you stay away from those kids. and away from that dog.
tripp.
then you must have at some point tried to reverse the procedure.
what the fuck are you.. ?
you know, he was formerly a sailor.
i have played a few times. here and there. as a matter of fact, i was once a rehearsal pianist for a las vegas musical revue.
no. poetic justice, though.
it works a little.

we're not sure...
just lucky, i guess.
baker's unabridged.
i heard about today.  good job.  i'm all for capital punishment.  why don't you go home and see your family?
why?
great, get in. we'll switch off in a bit.
what about you?
these are the ground rules.  i hook up with one guy a season-- i mean it takes me a couple of weeks to pick the guy--kinda my own spring training...  and, well, you two are the most promising prospects of the season so far.  so...  i thought we should get to know each other.
i don't think she knows.
has she talked with you since prison?
none available, captain. there's no one in fact, who's fully rated on this design.
i think it's a pig hair. <i></i> how much is mcdonald's offering?
you don't drink "booze".
i don't want to need you!
considering what?
look, if it wasn't you who sent the letter, and it wasn't me who sent it?
i'm sorry about your financial problems.  i really am. but they are your problems.
what does that mean?  what does he do?
where'd you go to school, kid.  wellesly?
i remember that night.  d'artagnan was drunk, the only time i've seen him that way.  the three of us were reveling, remember, athos?
it's okay, son.  we just need to call you something.  that's all.
nevermind.  it's not real -- it's a hoax.  a prank.  he's hiding in a barn. hey, turn left here.  left!
bullshit.  put the phone down, mason.
my compliments to you, miss stella. this is what i call a saloon.
too busy eating us?
tomorrow i'm going to put sean on the bus.  he won't want to go.  he never does.  he'll cry and want to hold on to me.
dad, i'm trying to figure things out right now, ok? it's like, really hard, and i'm just listening to some old elton john and...
this guy was a bad monkey.  he dabbled in all the black arts, and listen to this prophecy.  just before his head died, his last words were, "death is but a door, time is but a window.  i'll be back."
everything will die, mason.
no.  pursuit <u>ends</u> when we know exactly where he is.
you must have a bible in here, don't cha?
and what does he say to you?
i think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.
yes. he's more than four thousand years old and still decomposing.
he's here.
yes. those little pieces of paper with your picture on it?
a young albanian girl, dressed in their...
come here, son...
you mean he withdrew...
i don't want to discuss it.
great. donovan actually said the words "good work, ms. woods". he takes me seriously! can you believe it?
you are so brilliant.
well, have you asked her to come back?
get outta my way.
two minutes, 35 seconds.  damnit, i'm involved in this thing, so i just wanna know what this thing is. i wanna be treated as an adult.
the second note to wake the gods...
it makes it faster. if i don't speak to the men, they fall faster. it's pretty obvious why.
like what?
my son, i foresaw this. i knew -
this isn't happening.
it's-it's got bad plumbing and bugs. jesus, i'll-my accountant will write it off as a tax deduction, i'll pay for it.
<u>nashville</u>...?
all right, let's see if you're willing to put that statement to a test.
you mean you'll tell us his name???
terry...?
oh, naw. hi.
now you thought of that, not me.
he's got a date, he's got a date, is this guy fantastic...?  already he learned how to write a movie, and he found a girl to get his toes curled, what a guy, what a...what a literary find...!
good boy.
they'll never find out.
i don't care what you said, we had an agreement. you've slept with half of the borough so don't tell me you're being choosy.
really? i thought it was appropriate maybe. that's all.  i really admire the work that you do. i know it's not proper to be so familiar but i guess since we're outside the workplace i feel a certain liberty to --
watching my son...ted, i've been living in new york for the past two months.
neo, this has to be done!
to him? he's a sick freak.
yeah -- guess i got revved up at the idea of an evening among adults -- no offense buster.  you meet chad the nanny?
yes sir. it turns out we put an innocent man into the "park" and he was not the one who stole from the stamp machine. that is also about the time when bruce began refusing.
the same.
i've been saving it. for the right moment.
i love it.  i really do.  i've never been this happy, or comfortable anywhere.
i don't know. not a war exactly. it's more a... a misapprehension maybe...
i figured that. well you better be careful with that cripple in the back. you'll throw him out. looks like you got a wagonful.
i think we wait right here.
i didn't have any choice.
you're gonna be sick are you?
and i'll be a visitor.
yes, yes i know. victor, whatever i do, will you believe that i, that --
fuck you.
better than good, he is a fucking liability.
-- i've looked at every piece of publicity she's ever done, the video in the supermarket, there's no evidence she's ever left the studio.  oh, and for some reason this woman leaves no paper trail.  but i have "obtained" a copy of your bank accounts.  i know you have power of attorney but so far you haven't transferred one single solitary cent to her.

and the white house?
i don't think so, homer. *i'm* the lucky one.
the boy is happy, fred.  don't be such a killjoy.
we are covering up!  for some petty, stupid shit.  there are things i can say -- when other people say them, they'd be lies. but when i say them nobody believes me anyway ...
what? oh -- no -- i'm just --
okay... have them get it out of the tank.
who are you?  what are you doing out here?
i would like a word with this orderly harbin.
yeah, teresa, shut up!  we don't wanna get charlie here in trouble, do we?...we love charlie.
you gotta keep lonnegan's con, even after you spent his money.  and no matter how much you take from his, he'll get more.
how much you weigh right now, fry? huh?
she's nervous, naturally, under the circumstances.
no.

unfortunately.  we can't.
i want to see pilgrim.
is there any other way to disable the injector?
yeah... thank you.
that staggering. his dying so quickly.  in your campaigns, have you never seen men who staggered before they died, who talked incoherently —— walked blindly.
in time you will meet them all.

i trusted mitchell.  it was that damn big mouth wife of his.
...this man.
thank you.
well find some other way!  be creative.  tell them she fucks the devil... hmm, not a bad idea... why can't you say that?  sounds good to me... and who can prove she doesn't?
story of my life.
it's the tothian mine field left standing from the great war of 12185.

yes they do, they do, but i'll make my dreams come true, you see?  i will.
good as new! it's quite all right--
what ?
it's simple, you just go to the bathroom.
yo, a bad reputation -- twenty years from now people will say 'd'you remember marie?' 'no, who was she?' 'she was that little whore who hung out at the atomic hoagie shop.' 'oh, now i remember!'... see, they don't remember you, they remember the rep.
what are you talking about?

what you got me up here for?
well, i think you're the fucking anti-christ.
no, no, no. we know all that. what happened with you?
213-555-4679. that's all. i just wanted to leave my number. i don't want you to think i'm weird, or desperate or something...  ...i mean, you know, we should just hang out. that's it. no expectations. just, you know, hang out. bye. 
i know.  it's terrible!

what do you think about when you're having sex?
well, has it ever occurred to you that the reason you've been so busy lately is because the dead have been rising from their graves?
what?
who the hell are you?
so you're gonna take the word of some trick over pop's?  he wouldn't lie.
right -
please excuse leah. she's mentally challenged.

no. are you drunk?
yeah, well, i wish god would go a little easy on the trumpets.

because i am a moral person.
my son thomas came to see you this afternoon, and he said to you he wants to cast his mother from his house?
why?!
i think she's pretty, mommy.
okay, finish your count and get it up here as soon as you can.  i don't wanta be here all night.

she hid it from us, doctor. she's afraid of the hospital.
i swore not to talk about him tonight, but there's all this stuff i think i ought to tell you, that he didn't get a chance to.  rafe was...he was lonely.  he had such high expectations of himself that he always felt empty.  the week he met you he told me he felt his heart had always lived in winter, and for the first time in his life he has seen the spring.
benjamin?
maybe pants.
i'd be glad to.  not now, of course -- with you alone.

i should get a garter belt.
did you tell him you did?
you mean you can't fall in love?
we have to launch his ship by tomorrow afternoon.
all i need--
put the whole thing in an envelope and mail it through a porthole--
know him?
do you have any more of these deli- cious cookies?
just want to talk to him a second.
a heck of a lot. what'd you say you were gonna put there?
no, it's nothing!
not you.
well it's a honor to be here amongst so many fans of the genre. and i must say that any of you worried that jerry rapp, or tori or david not returning to complete the stab trilogy, have no fear, roman is here. aided with my excellent cast of newcomers i believe we're going to pull off one of the best stabs yet.
-- we needed cohesion to move forward. not conjecture.
i think i could help.  you gonna tell me you don't need help?
yes.
what?
yeah, they were sluts. huh huh huh.
then take the final step... give me the enterprise... and we can be together... always.
yes.
the what?
of course, i'm your attorney, i'll give you all the time you need, at my normal rates: $45 an hour -- but you'll be wanting a cushion, so, why don't you just lay one of those $100 bills down there beside the radio, and fuck off?
and you tore up your knee.  rehab is tough.
there's another reason?  it better be good.
you weren't straight with us, frankie, what else could we do?
okay, so the problem is still the nun outfit, right?
they what? what? no. no. why?
sounds like you got a conflict of interest.
i am not...a guerilla fighter, toby. i'm not a pioneer. i'm not...i'm not strong that way. i need...
you'll be fighting with the octopus.
where's doc?!
why?
yes.
where's turley?
oskar, there are twelve hundred people who are alive because of you.  look at them.
no! i don't expect you to believe anything. except that the responsibility is mine. and the disgrace.
yes, we're in new york now.  but where are you planning to stay in new york?
i don't see anything.
careful, it's slippery.  i had it waxed.
don't gimme that.
but, i don't know. i'm just scared that things would change. between us.
naw! not a major.
no, wait. you can't just walk off.  you saved my life.
don't say those things. you forget about those dreams..
...a monstrosity!  who would do that?
what plates?
more fancy talk... you want to know what haddonfield is? families. children, all lined up in rows, up and down these streets. you're telling me they're lined up for a slaughterhouse.
yes?
oh yes.  i killed him.
no.
because memphis is the wrestling capital of the world!  i'll go in the ring, and i'll announce that i will shave my head and marry any woman who beats me!  then you'll come up, we'll wrestle and i'll let you win!  then you'll scalp me, and we'll get married on letterman, like tiny tim did on carson... right there on the show!  what do you say???
he just completely ignores me. he could have at least said something, introduced me or something.
oh yes, she's very nice.
so now it's tasker?  not renquist?
rob, i just want you to know, you're the only one i can talk to about her.
okay... then how 'bout we try out some french cuisine.  saturday?  night?
not ... to leave the room ... even if you come and get him.
listen to me. it's hard enough.
i want you to hit me as hard as you can.
you listen, you're not going to have much of a livelihood if this man dies. he's got the rale, he's very weak, and i don't know how much damage has been done by his "fall". now stop wasting time and fetch a cab.
nobody.
yes.  a switch hitting witch. very common in puerto rico.
yes... well, i hope the crew got back safely.
don't tell anyone you're a worker. follow that column over there.  and come right back after the inspection!
that's a wonderful profession.  my daughter-in-law's a nurse.  what did you do, stop?
hello.
too bad we have to waste all that time.
that was thursday.
get a grip. reed. we didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch. just close the shields...
to the palace at whitehall.
shhhhh, i'm concentrating!
don't they? he's down at the tombs right now.
you got the shit?
i'm ted, by the way. i think i forgot to say that.
no, toto, nobody said it. i say it! life's not like you saw it in the movies. life...is harder.  get out! go back to rome. you 're young, the world is yours! and i'm old...i don't want to hear you talk any more, i want to hear talk about you.
no! i just wanted
thank you.
you're up late.
"you send me."
for her, they might make an exception.  if not, i'm afraid she'll become a poisoned dragon.
take wing!
nothing, nothing, mr. dickson. don't pay any attention to me. i don't know what i'm saying.
if i was healthy, i could take that away from you.
never happened!
that's happening in about ten minutes. israel's at optimum risk of flight right now, so we can't wait.
what are you saying?
like hell you will.  you'll buy me a cab.
if you take anybody, please take me.
did you ever sleep with dela?
that's nice.
we have more officers created by congress than we know what to do with.
yeah, i like it, i'm high up, i can see everything, you know? it's the cadillac of minivans.
then why don't you testify?
i was afraid of that.
yes, but george . . .
okay.  please, i have a headache, all right?
oh, that's ok, a lot of men feel uncomfortable when they come in here.
anything!  just make contact.
you what?
we're not in a tournament, gump.  ah, but a sword twice tempered in the blood of living dragons...
shutup! -- after all! you haven't talked to me for a week and now i'm going to say my piece. i've got a prediction for you, norville barnes: i predict that since you've decided to dedicate yourself to greed and sloth and everything bad, you're going to lose all the good things that your good ideas brought you. you're going to throw them all away chasing after money and ease and the respect of a board that wouldn't give you the time of day if you... if you...
pardon me?
last year was awful rough--mama passing on and the whole business with o.j.--i mean it's not like it was don meredith or roger staubach or one of our own boys, but it really knocked me for a loop--
so am i. my friends were killed, too.
okay, get your clothes on. i got the cab downstairs.
...as soon as andy got back home, nicky heard about our talk in the car.
kill drive engines.
what i did to joey.
i don't accept the idea that he knows who his letter writer is, jane. because i don't accept the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw marty in his wheelchair.
be brave!  otho take care!  onward!
i'm an investigator. i'd like to ask you some questions about tom grunemann.
no, i mean david ravell. he's a surgeon.
that's why he was so quiet.  he was testing us.
any man that can write may answer a letter.
yeah.
yes!  yes, i want her so badly i can taste it.  that's the whole point. look at us.  orphans.  isolated. obsessed to the exclusion of life, love, family.  we're perfect targets. she's done something to us, got us fighting over her somehow.
mr decker....
the whole city's together on this one.  we took a vote.  everybody's down on you, you know.
she can out-run us and out-gun us. but there is the mutara nebula at 153 mark four.
jim--when the lightning hit, i--i just--
you said it!  here's looking at you, kid.
one. b-a-b-a-r.
you're not missing much.  he's cuckoo.
what did darryl say?
yes, baron.  moon in champagne.
for the moment.  we're in the main hangar.  artoo is trying to plug into the system now.
no self confidence, i guess... at least you don't take after him.
...you wanna work -- here?
no. in hampstead... why?
good. then may i have the honor of extending an invitation to you?
i'm here to talk to you, sonny, not ...
in a sense.
say what you're saying.
look, snap out of it, will ya?
no it wasn't janet -- exactly -- it was, in fact, your new sponsor.
my father.
oh really. home of the exposed brick wall and the  houseplant.
not great.  plus, i've got things on my mind.  you know.
give me the gun.
oh that's nice for you.
<u>no</u>!  do not encourage this little... person.
i need to get something straight first.
i'd say you turned out just fine.
if i can smoke it.
order!
do you want to see it? i can run upstairs and get it...
you're right, mothershead, please forgive me... of course, i appreciate everything you've done for john, and i'm glad that you are concerned about his welfare. but, i'm the physician in charge and i must do what i think best. i'm also very late, so please forgive me.
where are you going?
like hell!  i'll see it through! ram the bastard!
hm?
maybe i'll tell you later.
it's been six months.
oh, you know. she was sixteen or seventeen.
i'm so relieved.
kay--
then carmine fucillo and tony blue derosa will need to be fitted for slabs.
ultra ninja megazord complete!
whatever.  okay. "tell laura i love her." that'd bring the house down. laura's mom could sing it.
well, you know how those millionaires are.  these came for you.
don't be ridiculous.
yeah.
you could have said no.
it's a rebound.
how would you know, brandon?
i'm sure sorry. i - shep told me 8:30. it was a mix-up, i guess.
huh?
this is so weird.  it's happening, but it's not.  it's like a tv show, and we're part of it.
doing the bachelor party thing?
you know how much money he had in the bank when he died?  nothing.  he was so damned honest ...  but i miss him.  i miss him a hell of a lot.
it's okay... i've never been a detective before either...
then help her.
uh, yeah. does she have big hooters?
okay, let me rephrase that question.  didn't you once coach a basketball team for underprivileged children?
here --  take him home.
yes.
is it now?
not a great idea. especially 'cross the street.
and her...?
she'll go into coma.
what else do we do?!
who cares?
why?... why should you carry other people's bags?
ben schwarz.
-- i've got the tapes. if you ever want to see your brother out of jail do exactly what i say. bring one million euros to your boat at six o'clock.
why don't you come down to la? stay with us for a while.
wouldn't dream of it, sir.
come on in, betty,
sit down, everybody - for heaven's sake!
it's nothing ... nothing.
that stuff about the mig. i was out of line.
or was bumped off by someone who was afraid of him.
i'm sorry.
she didn't.
what kinda man lets a woman answer the door, this time a night?
what right you got to be talkin' marriage to any decent woman...
oh –– clarence. hasn't got his wings yet, has he? we've passed him up right along.
is this the best you can do?
it dawned on me one day that we were supposed to be a nation founded on the principle of questioning authority... and all i did here was follow orders. it didn't add up. plus, i got kicked out.
holy sh--
it led me away from umbrella frames, for one thing. but that left me without any honest means of support.
i've done much better ones than this.
m'm, wait, i got a great idea.  hang in there for a second. i got a little-little artifact. a little erotic artifact, that-that i brought up from the city, which i think, uh, is gonna be perfect.  i just... there... there's a little old new orleans... essence. now-now we can go about our business here and we can even develop photographs if we want to. there, now there.  m'mmm. m'mmm. hey, is something wrong?
yeah.  we already been there.  this is big, kenny.  benjamins.  secret service calls 'em superbills.  banks can't even tell the difference.
he's not anybody to tell somebody else what to do in a master bedroom.
guess i'm not a single type guy.
this is colonel richards.
well, let me see... they tore down the george orwell monument and put up a bust of george michael. main street's a four-laner, no left turns four to seven. i was married and divorced. and grosse pointe is now officially the new sister city to lower hutt, new zealand. we have fiber-optic town meetings every two months.
it's perfectly safe. i promise.
what happened...?
only a tiny bit.  even the most devout believer is allowed a little doubt.
when are we going out?  you and me?
how do we start?
well when can we do something?
he said, 'don't mind him. his job is to criticise, your job is to conduct.'
in 1959, the united states was very friendly with the shah of iran.  we wanted his oil, so for the shah's birthday, the government gave him a gift -- a u.s. treasury intaglio press.  the only one to ever leave the country. five years ago ricky tan bought that press on the black market.
good idea.  we'll grab a bite.
you are looking unseasonably hot. let's go inside and grab your rocks.
i mean, it's not true, is it?
a miracle is an event without an explanation. if she's capable of putting a hole in her hand without benefit of a nail, why couldn't she split a cell in her womb?
what about the intro?
okay, guys, we're here. l.a. county jail. julie, just park in the front.
you know, like bang her or anything?
yeah.  thanks man.
well, i think --
it <u>is</u> beautiful. but i got a little tired of sleeping in antiques, so i gave it to my secretary.
my hands?
you and i have been doing this together for fourteen years.
yeah, i have, i have, yeah.
sure. it'd be fun.
have you known him long?
what's the matter? don't smell so good, huh? must'a broken some records.
not at all, i enjoyed --
we may be in trouble, i can't catch my breath. i've got the occupational disease of oversized ex-athletes.
raincheck.
what are you talking about? who are you?
how are you, miss peterson?
he's afraid of you, harold.  he knew you'd want to fight him.  he doesn't know anything about fighting.  he hates pain.
it's all over, babe, it's all over.
it sure was.
stanzi-manzi, i'll put it in your hand!
mm, what a waste of silicone.  what does my mother have to do with this all dewey? we're a long way from woodsboro.
resurrection.
worried!
okay, lovey.
hilarious.
"he's gonna croon love's tune,
when will that be ?
yeah, she won a fellowship.
no hiccups, which was good.  who wants an attorney who gets the hiccups when she gets nervous?  "your  honor, i  object!"
you think i'm lying?
you got a problem with me, grady?
i don't know.
recommendations?
i had to explain your tendancy to "exaggerate", how you were actually "in country" all of two weeks and how you killed about as many people as the other clerk-typists in your outfit, no more, no less...
yeah, we're here.
you know it's one thing to treat us this way, but how can you do this to your fans?...
an er doctor who spends his days saving lives was the one out of control --
so far they're keeping their part of it.
i got pinched in the elevator.
oh shit....oh shit...
you send them.  is that it, max?
i didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. i didn't have time to get a window, but i found this key.  pretty nifty, huh?
they've been kind to me.
they're topside.  we're ready to take you home, sir.
honey, this tie has a spot on it, i can't wear this today. i got a 10:30 with chuck.
yeah?
good.
this gets better by the minute.
what wouldja say if i toldja i ran into a burning plane an' saved a buncha people, chick, an' risked my goddamnlife?
are you in trouble with the law?
an alternative literary venue!
tell me--i'm dyin' to hear it.
max!  dammit!  <u>answer!</u>
any sign of our friend?
well, you needn't. i will not be tolerated. and i will not be plotted against!
you wouldn’t have a cigarette, would you?
i'll work on it...
why do people think i'm tyler durden?
well great. the pleasantville marathon starts at six thirty.
we've heard lots about you.
we're not moving! we have a right, a constitutional right, to assemble and be heard!
aaah!  nobody!  i can't tell you!
i don't be-leeve this.
so... even you don't believe in me anymore...
i don't know. maybe it's because i love debbie or maybe it's hard for me to get off in a place that smells like egg salad. i'm not sure.
it's only temporary. on a freelance basis.
i don't know.
no! arrgh!
ain't nobody stole dad's skiff.
yeah, well i wouldn't expect too much.
some people think you have an attitude problem, beckett.
hurry back.
mom ... i mean, it's amusing to imagine such a thing, but ... how many of those pills have you been taking?
yes?
i visited your home this morning, after you left.
hello, baby.
i don't remember.
she's not very nice, is she?
my boat's neat, dad!
i didn't want to bother you during your racquetball game.
i...i just need to know what state you're in so i know...how to talk to you...how to act...
we've come a long way since world war ii, major.  and the lessons we've learned are all in plan-r.
sure, they are students.
partnership?
then why are you teaching me...?
an' you won't let nobody touch me?
jack wouldn't kill for it. besides, who would pay him?
i've got jews at my table.
why?
ah. where?
a daughter.
nobody's gonna do that, mr. connell. they can't use the john doe clubs for politics. that's the main idea.
oh, yes. here it is.
i think we're falling in love.
if you were the only suspect in a senseless bloodbath would you be standing in the horror section?
ten here.
hey. you wasn't at'cha work but that nosey gal up at the counter give me your home address. hope you don't mind me comin' over.
it was... it was...
she told you exactly what you needed to hear.  that's all.  sooner or later, neo, you're going to realize just like i did the difference between knowing the path and walking the path.
i don't fucking know. what am i, his biographer?  olaf, what part of russia are you from?
no way.
that wouldn't have done any good. not with her.  she's the most incredible creature i've ever seen.
is that you, kid?
i'll walk back.
you tell dr. thurman whatever you want.
in the real world, when you get to where i am, there are other considerations...
this isn't a person to person call, mr. kitz.  i don't really think the civilization sending the message intended it just for americans.
i guess so.
sorry.  are you dating anyone?
why, the bill--the bill--to make a national boys' camp...
and what do you propose, professor? shall we hold a seminar to study the problem?
well then?  start proving... or else the church will have another martyr!
pull up behind that car.  okay for this one. take 'em through.
much more colorful than the ones we wear.  and, of course, less dented.
if we don't bypass it, the temperature in the mask room will change and set off the alarm. that would be inconvenient.
levene!
yes.
and now you must let me be the judge of that!
what did he say about miss lawson?
i fell in love.
homosexuality.
vegetable meaning paraplegic.
maybe the blood was from your period like before.
it's war, now get the fuck out of the way!
you hit a bad streak.  we've all... look at this: fifteen units mountain view, the fucking things get stole.
it says that this company has heavily fascist ties to the french secret army organization that tried to assassinate de gaulle in 1960.
you missed ... luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. made a phone call.
i thought the subject was sex?
reggie -- listen to me --
yah, but i - okay, i would, i'd guarantee ya your money back.
listen to me:  elanora <u>duse</u> was playing hamlet in london in 1905, and royalty could not get a ticket.  she said, "i'm not doing the seven shows a week i signed for."  she said, "i cannot bare my soul seven times a week.  i am an artist. i'll do four shows a week."  the greatest actress of her time.  you know what her producer said?
it's close.
i'll probably kill them. is that likely?
can't you--
james? my james? what's happened?
i just did it for tonight. i don't normally dress like this.
i know, their small town mentality can be maddening.
come on, old man, that won't do. you know you're innocent until proven guilty.
well, i know that now.
which is?
where do we start?
uh,  i don't know. i gotta tell you, i don't know.
you're kidding, right?
who the hell is he?
you're going to have to give me a little more than that, jimmy.
well, if we're friends, why can't we see each other?
oh, great.
so where would we go?
as in one minus one equals zero yes. where are you going with this?
good morning.  i'd-i'd-i'd like to look at some cuff links.
but i don't care about that now. he knew what he was doing today. he was laying down the conditions under which he might consent to our marriage - if i would bend to every whim of his, like sidney!  i couldn't do that, susie...
yeah - go on.
i don't know, this place is really dark, i can't see a thing...
who am i?
but it's not worth more than fifteen.
all right.  after they put you away...
why are you doing all this? to impress me?
who was it answered the phone?
they can't be serious. the ship's in pieces and we've less than a skeleton aboard.
you cannot marry wessex!
thanks.
a what?
yes.
yesterday yes, today no.  what happened last night?
it's about this.
then will you meet him, as a representative of the committee.
that's what i told them.
shit....
he's still out there!!!
leo, i don't know.
what’s his problem?
i-i-i-i would leave out the men's- room attendant.
i don't know, thel...this whole thing has happened so...pow, like that.
true.
i'll dispatch a convoy to meet him.
i'm afraid so.
and "is"...?
you were at 4000 kelvin. any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
fucking thing!!!
fine. one more thing, mrs and mr spitz; may i ask what is or was your occupation?
is it two? or is it three? have you ever really noticed?
it was april.  april seventeenth. that one i remember.
no...it's nothing to do with you. it's just that i was scared of coming back. now, after all these years, i thought i was strong, that i had forgotten lots of things. instead, i find it's quite the opposite, as if i had never left. and yet, i look at lia and feel as if i didn't know her, and you, mamma...i abandoned you, ran away like a thief, thought only of myself, and never gave you an explanation...
i'll pay you.
bourne?
not really. it's completely inert. no sound or energy sources have been detected. the surface is made of something incredibly hard and we've been barely able to scratch it. a laser drill
let me see.
look out!
of course! that's his one vulnerability. the one way he can be stopped.
hey -- i've gotta have a few clients when i get to wall street.
that's not what the dreams say he's doing.
bye, ted.
ah believe i smell me a blonde-haired lady.
every american should see the grand canyon. are you an american?
runnin' numbers illegal.
what a relief!
and sometimes it takes a long time, and you're fucking gagging.
don't worry, we're the only rangers this side of the continent, we've got to be first into caen.
righto.  let me see.
well, i like it here.
scare me, why don't you?!!?  you stupid son of a bitch!!!
let me help you.
absolutely,
york just turned up outside.  we're trying to get him into infirmary.
sure, but -- she could still have gotten your side for the record!
here are tonight's calls.
oh, i'll teach you how to surf even if you don't get the gig.
wait...
you've suckered me before, darling, remember? why should i believe you now?
thanks for the consultation....
he climbed when he was ready.
that's what we call in the trade, audition free-for- alls and most of it sucks. bit i don't think that's her.
is it that bad?
i've seen 'em.  lot to dust.
of course you will.
nothing going on here, everybody stand back. let him through, ladies. ladies, please. as they start to move through the female throng, a little girl pops out in front of them, holding her ball.
it would be so okay.
you know, i don't know.  and looking at you, i don't care.  it's been too long, eve.
undoubtedly, i know the breed, he may be a cowboy, but his word is his word.
shut up.
no, i do. i want to tell you.
nothing, really...
now just get off the train.
stop that ma'am crap!
is that any way to say hello?
don't thank me. i should thank you. so long.
sounds like a rough one.
guess there's no way i'll ever know. for sure.
yes -- oh!
i can look at dead things.
ah, i see.  a purely...plutonic relationship.
tell me something, dorie.  a man as big as you -- and smart too, you knew where to come when your ship couldn't help -- do you still have to fight with your fists to get respect?
... you knew you had a double?
...gotta run dad. you stop smoking, you hear?
here, right around centaurus a.
great. and your all set for the performance?
i can explain--
retainer...
how much time is left?
male, 40 to 50 years old, five-foot- eleven, chewed tobacco--then we get into the dental records--
don't you believe it. later on there will be human sacrifices -- white collar workers tossed into the computing machines, and punched full of those little square holes.
wonderful psychology. why don't you say something about my mom?  excuse me.
he's just a regular guy't needs help, honey. look at him.
just keep your lying, heathenous trap shut, jeremiah.
sorry to disturb you, chief but we have new developments.
he ain't going out.  and if i go out he's just gonna kill the people. there's a lot of lives that i'm responsible for... that's all.  so, i can't do anything.  i got myself into this mess and i'll get myself out of it... the best way i know how!  one of the ways is not giving up.  i'm telling ya!
when are you going to start?
then i have time for a drink.
no, i haven't, mom. i promise you... i saw it!
not to me, you know that.
i'm going downstairs to get a beer. you want one?
w-w-where we g-g-going?
that would leave one exit for hundreds of people.  you'd be violating every fire regulation on the books.  we'll guard the perimeter with my men and engage the motion detectors in the other cells.  one more question.  i see a big hole.  if this entire thing is run by computer, what happens if the power fails?
just take it, take the money in my pockets, take it, it's fine --
uh-huh.
i need to find this technician, or anyone else who knows about project manticore. they would've used surrogate mothers to carry you after the in-vitro work... if i can track down one of them.
it wasn't your fault.  the soldiers were just kids, too.  they panicked.
no.
shut-up and gimme your bandolier.
no, this is great.
hey, it's your bar mitzvah. i'm just readin' the torah portion.
she's a friend of mine
i'm her sister.
they're converting the deflector dish into an antennae...
george, hallo!  today is the day, ah? are you out?
jos, that's not what we're --
what, mr. de santis?
did you ever turn tricks before?
from what you saw, did huey newton start the shooting?
that little prick.
i don't know how he does it.
you said five hundred and fifty!
right, i guess those are the kids --
there's nothing to expose.
the bridge is fine, taylor, how are things down there?
so what do we do?
no.
happy now?
after that my parents never let me go to dignan's again.
how many people in the bus?
you know what i really like?
so jason doesn't sleep... how does that help us?

gardiner, yes, sir.
all i'm asking is you test it beforehand!
i asked you a direct question!  a glimpse of what?!
me?
yes.
what are you doing? you can’t. i...
fine.
this is a premeditated puzzle, and it's only the beginning.
tell me, michael.  what really happened with pentangeli?
i promise you, i didn't know!
what?
no!--did <u>you</u> take that bracelet?
--i already get the post. i don't need another subscription.
hugo. hugo. sorry about this, but can you open the door? it's us, hugo, your flatmates and companions. your new-found friends. he's not in. he's left and we'll probably never see him again.
i knew you'd come.
you look great.  your dad taking good care of you?
cut that shit out.  maybe before, but not now. i want to help you. i'm on your side.
long gone, huh?
not particularly.
don't let him get you.  just continue your patterns and pretend he's not around.
oh boy. if he only knew.
yeah, well, perhaps...  speaking of which:  i have a <u>prescription</u> here, i'm going to give you the <u>number</u>, i need you standing by with a <u>crate</u> of the stuff.... it's ... what is it?
bet.
i have given a great deal of thought to that possibility, and i am prepared to face it.  if it should come to war, and i presume that is what you are alluding to, i would rather have war with the emperor than my own people.
stop him, clark!
another attack?
that's the power source that was lost from argo city! that's what i came: to find! where does she live?
tomorrow is another day.
the same, your majesty.
veronica, i love you...
i'll give you anything you want. anything!  please!
what's in sandusky?
new jersey brought her back to the bus through heavy fire.  quite a guy if you want my opinion.
as soon as you're hitched, sal. first we get you hitched.
anyway, i gotta get to this meeting. tell your mom i'm gonna be late.
i know, everyone says that.
even though he knew about you?
have you been receiving medical treatment for any serious illness?
and burgel is the bringer of messages, isn't he?
it's not all right.  come on, dad
all right, then -- i'll tell them who did do it!
i wouldn't worry about money. i'll make it worth your while.
they're trying to intimidate us.  tell them to wait in the conference room.
coulda been a contender.
i said when i think about you, i get wet.
that song did not come up in my research, captain.
local?
you will notice, though, that there are no more phases.  only four forms are shown.  after that the pattern repeats.
what's daddy doing?
no, stay. just for a little while.  refill?
much better--thank you--
you're out of time, man.
joey never told you we went out, did he?
what about not-so-great writers?
short pieces, huh? you should try to write songs.
i really did think i was still in reality. at least, until now.  beam me up, scotty!
how fascinating. do go on ...  ... john.
take it.
she's in the holding cell, on this floor.
175  continued:
kill me? well, alright. go ahead. take the empire. all yours.  hell, harv, old pals. i'll kill me for you.
tell me where you are, or just leave the line open so i can trace you.
not even the slightest hint of something?
uh, his birthday, uh, may.  i think.
you can't talk to it?
what's your favorite color?
victory is mine.  i thank thee o lord that in thy ...
this an accident, walter?
look more closely.
what?
yes, he is different... not the kind of person one usually meets in washington.
did he?
do you have to be so cold to him?
danny, what makes you think you know all this?
i can't believe it. this is too good to be true.
perfectomundo! we are ready!  say, wouldn't it be wonderful to have an insect repellent lotion that also worked as a sun block? think of all the time one would save.
the canadians are just mad that we mothers here in south park have the chutzpah to stand up to them!  like it or not, mr. canadian minister, our children are now safe from your canadian smut!
just so you do your work.
what's that supposed to mean?
-- is often sneered at. are you aware of that?
i just stopped by to tell you that i checked out the acme probate.
i'm sorry to barge in on you like this. but i was supposed to talk to luis carruthers and he wasn't in and...well, you're here, so...i know how busy you guys can get.
he takes after our mother.
tradition.  royal sense of adventure that's been in my family for centuries.  dates back to the crusades and king richard.  what i was born to do.
yes...
no.
well, he's popular. a lotta people like janiro. you beat him and it only figures they'll wanna see you get a title shot. but, what do i know? i should keep my mouth shut, i should...
alvy, you're a total paranoid.
it's awright, tommy. i wisht you didn't do it, but you done what you had to do. i can't read no fault in you.
hey ben. there were a couple of guys looking for you.
what kind of trouble?
well, after all, it's my apartment -- it's private property -- it's not a public playground.
believe me, professor, running around on a nuclear test site can't be any more dangerous than what i've been doing.
do you remember the figures we discussed?
got it.
i thought you said we were going to be friends.
and all these rooms here?
it will.
so, take it off.
i can't pick you up.
oh, honey!
go where?
yes sir.
good. what do you have?
we're missing two of the kids!
yes i do! i know exactly what i am saying.  and if it is sedition, then i am guilty of sedition, too!
i been mindin' pearl.
we raised such a fuss they finally brought cots in.
be verwy, verwy, quiet; i'm hunting catwomen.
sounds good, talby. let me know if anything important comes up.
he knows better than that.
that black book is a bunch of bullshit. they got two names in there for the whole country and one of them is still al capone.
yeah.  well, me too.
what? do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear?
you woke me up to tell me that?
it's terrific!
i don't think that's such a good idea.
just remember, lamar, i could have gone up and back and nobody would have been the wiser--
okay, matt.
why, i love my father because - because i do. of course, he's nice to me.
me.
i'm...inside you.
don't cry -- you'll rust yourself again!
then why does he persecute me? my family told me what kind of man he is, how he stole my mother and then abandoned her --
what do you mean? where do you think?
my head is suddenly killing me. maybe it's from all the learning today.
helluva awgazation.
fine man to fall in love with.
yes... i've always wondered what patrick swayze is like in real life.
that was before twombley was shot. before he knew.
keep it up.
yo, carlos-i'm gonna punch you.
you don't know the deetzes very well, do you?  my father bought this place.  he never walks away from equity.  why don't <u>you</u> leave?
how?
okay, okay, i'm sure that i just...
we sent the prints we lifted from the counter at the bank to the state computers, the fbi and interpol. nothing.
which one?
-- he's so strange i don't know if you really even would want to go out with him, someone like him, i said i'd try, but it's just --
i know i'm better than what i've been doing the last ten years, walking around in a tank top and fuck-me pumps, waiting till it's time to scream.
well, bitch you move too slow.
no, you?
you haven't been by lately.
they run routes mostly east, retail stuff, warehouses. but gabriel knows some guys in new york, miami, guys he helps get guns to detroit. hides 'em with his regular loads.
cowan--
that'll be the day.
and now come on, mary. i want to show you the all-fired biggest parsnips in the whole united states, raised right here in marshfield -- of course!
christian svenson.
it was right there on top. isn't she pretty?
if that's what they want to do, they're doin' it.
thank you, sir. i've looked forward to this for a long time.
slam doctor. well, we called him "doctor."
please hurry up - just get him on the telephone.
i don't blame him. what should i do with the ice?
he looks like my uncle.
my brushes, i have to clean my brushes.  thanks, though.
then it's a good thing.
not so fast. we're gonna play a little game. it's called guess who just called the police and reported your sorry motherfucking ass?
yeah, i think so...
were you there to catch me?
you "friend's" a murderer and he ruined our perfect record.  six years, not one damn murder...
i'll take it.
my job, bruce. i started it -- and i'll finish it.
it's me.  put the gun down.  maya...
for "james?"
far out.  larry? it's fletch.  well, it's not 'fat sam's', but... any port in a storm.  oh, tell frank i need a couple of months. the fifty grand's lasting longer than i thought.
god, you're beautiful.
in my world -- before i left it - only youngsters of your age wore un- scraped hair.
i don't feel anything.
up ahead!
rob, you don't know how it was for me back in high school. no one ever threw juice boxes at you in the hallway. you never dreamed about being popular- you already were. all i wanted was to be accepted, and they just fucking tortured me. i can't do all that again. i can't go back to southglen south.
alright, thanks.
<u>ten</u> million.  ten million in negotiable u.s. treasury certificates, in bearer form, coupons attached.  and one more thing -- your personal assurance that job will be at the exchange.
it's a letter from the school . . . from miss stewart.
yeah.  nobody saw <u>anything</u>?
if i don’t get to the boa before he gets to maiden’s tower, m is dead.
save me!
i do wish you'd tell me where you're going.
i'm just saying, not in this particular case.
is that the queen's request?
i'd rather sit down for this one, elaine.
wait a minute -- i thought we were negotiating here.
mine?
that prick tried to get jessica to blow him in the bathroom --
<u>not personal</u>?  that's my <u>work</u> in there, ed. my sweat, my labor, my time.  if that's not personal, i don't know what is.
so swann was performing magic. not illusions?  and what?  you thought he should be using it to cure cancer, not making millions.
-- turn around.
how come it bumps up and down when there's no road?
and you came all the way down here to see me?
i wanna be with you today.
that's the idea, walter.  it's the only way to gain recognition. all the big art critics and art dealers would be there, it would be an event.
you're not a man because of a job, duff.
you work that out with la senora.  you will get sixteen fuel bladders of crystal meth precursors from the malaysian ship.  for collection in north miami.  you warehouse it. release it when we say.  i'm sure you have friends with fast boats...
if you can trail him to a remote area do it. we all want a piece of him but let's keep our heads and stay within the law - we got people everywhere out here.
i didn't plan this.
well, i'll ask him, but i don't think he'll be very keen. he's already got one, you see?
yeah, mom?
would such, a demonstration be possible before the meeting?
yeah. funny twist, isn't it?
in a minute...
thanks.  i am.  where's martha?
i didn't know where else to keep it.  where would you?
he doesn't want to spend the weekends with you anymore.
fuck your struggle.  i want out.
jesus.
actually, i like to divest just before a major re-capitalization.
we've been talking about her, mostly.
who is "danny terrio?"
oh, yeah.  i didn't know my dad.  well, i knew him, till i was six.  he went and married another woman, had more kids. every six years or so he'd do it again -- new city, new family.
i'll be right there.
especially, the one of the young nobleman, you remember?
so you hid the truth.  deliberately.
huh. jack loves golf. crazy about it.
millie's been after me to fix her up with a date, so i...
oh, beware of jealousy, my lord, the green-eyed monster...
thank you.
thank you
you mean, besides the warrant out on us for blowing up our commanding officer?
i'm gonna sell the other two tonight. this group of koreans in koreatown have started a neighborhood watch kinda thing. and they want a few weapons so the neighborhood niggas know they mean business. so i'm gonna sell 'em my two machine guns tonight. only problem, i ain't never dealt with these koreans before. now i ain't worried. asians are by and large real dependable. they don't want no trouble. you might argue about price, but you ain't gotta worry about them shootin' you in the back. but i got me kind of a rule. never do business with nobody you ain't never done business with before without backup. that's why i need you, backup.
no. he was. i got him out.
no, no, its alright. i talked to my ex, he'll keep denny over christmas and i'll get him this summer.  goddam it, skipper... i haven't seen him in two months.
really?
firefly.
yes, exactly, but his first, his first conclusion was that signor miles was killed not later than seven o'clock yesterday evening.
oh -- now let's talk like adults. you want to tell us now a along story of what your factory can do. we know all that you could tell us and if you tell the truth it wouldn't sound so good. when you first approached us...
seventy-five percent.
good. i'd like to book a massage.
fine, but promise me one thing. if we use her, i want to direct those episodes. she's my discovery.
the venom of bad memories.  you were there; you saw her.  i saw you seeing her.
the safety of the men -- that's more important! five accidents this week -- all because of speed-up. you're a woman, you don't know what it's like up there.
fuck you, too nick.
you have been acting very strange the last few weeks.
because he is trying to retire me.
are you afraid of me?
okay.
it would be my child.
i need your help.
arnie, i feel like alice stepping through the looking glass.
he's fast, captain, i saw him.
kinda funny, though, isn't it? we're not supposed to be making weapons like that anyway. guess we shoulda played by the rules.
northeast sir!
something like that -
yeah, i figured maybe sometime this week we could go to a cafe and have some caramels.
detained by what?
no!  i'm not kidding.  don't you understand?  you're pure!
brilliantly moving.
recommendations.
shhh... it's okay.
sorry.  i know it looks like i'm reversing my field.
not a one.
not for me.
you do not report for duty unless the queen requests it.  you know that very well.
came by to check on you.
you're english.
you're talking nonsense.
long enough.
we had the best organization that black people ever had and niggers ruined it.
oh, you need a shave. you mustn't go looking like that. there's a razor and shaving cream in the bathroom. compliments of the house.
taken what?
then it's not your problem.
when's your baby due?
but why risk yourself? hasn't this family suffered enough?
yeah...you want me to know i ain't got no kin -- no money -- no horses -- nothing but a dead man's clothes to wear!..you tole me that already... now shut your head!
no, i don't.
no...
i don't want to bore you with all the sordid details of my life; it's not a happy story...
it's broke i guess. there's an electric in the bedroom.
we pushed it. we got lazy.
i stole your beat, huh? guess you forgot to brown-nose the right people.
don't tell me what to do.
you'll cry like a great big, blubbering baby.
excuse me for asking, but you aren't married, are you?
it's just going to take a while.
i asked you first.
he's so dreamy.  he's like... a greek god.  he's the cutest guy here.    he's boss.  he's fab.  he's...
not yet. listen, norman, i want...
you're not lying to me, are you?
no... no...
what about the cellular phone bill?
i can't eat before a game.
or i did it for some kind of kinky thrill.  score with a bank robber the way some women go for rough trade.
oh, george ...
what is it?
just a little... what's the difference?
we haven't. i wanted to talk that over with you, too.
you bet your raggedy white ass i am.
the speedometer of her car showed she had driven 94 miles that day. where did she go?  i have to know, scottie. where she goes and what she does, before i got involved with doctors.
i have no idea what howard doyle eats. i'm not a damn dietician.
"intra-agency fraternizing."
just like that?
look bella, i don't know anything about this. you should talk to matt.
no.  not something new.
well, that's the general idea, my dear.
what's the matter, leo?  don't you like coney island?
--howard hunt?
i won't disturb anything, mr. yow, i promise. be gone before you know it.
i just want to find a suitcase.
mr. scott, there's an alien object with unbelievable destructive power less than three days away from this planet...
oh!
antonio--
oh, i wouldn't kid you . on the level, it actually happened. nobody bought a paper that day. they followed me all over town and read the news from the seat of my pants.
you like your dad's paintings?
how about if we just go quietly into the bathroom and i wash your mouth out with soap - you pathetic button down bureaucratic asshole.
george.  oh, jesus christ, george.  look at you.
while you eat, you look at the view.
that viper has envenomed the water. no animal will drink here now.
just what is your question?
that's all i wanted to know!
what's your real name?
no, i mean it. no, look, when, when i got out of the car i walked all the way here.
you turn into him, check him out, identify friend or foe.
i used to think my biography would be jack lucas - the face behind the voice, but now it can be jack lucas, the face "and" the voice...or maybe just jack - exclamation point...
do you know what ethan will do if he has a chance?...he'll put a bullet in her brain! and i tell you martha would want him to!
the nanobot is still inside you. it's programmed to exit through the urinary tract.  we need it as soon as possible, so swallow those.
let me get at that typewriter and i'll show you how a doll-faced mugg can write!
knock it off! we got two men need attention here. police up your extra ammo and frags, don't leave nothing for the dinks. hoyt, junior, carry gardner.
i don't know what you're talking about.
what are you doing here?
dumont!
well now, launcelot, galahad, and i wait until nightfall and then leap out of the rabbit and take the french by surprise, not only by surprise but totally unarmed!
if you want to tell me.
-- it's always bad and it's never anything but bits and pieces anyway!  you ever think that maybe it's just making it worse? you don't wonder that?
i would imagine that we are, now. i think i'm ready to use the bathroom, finally.
where would i go?
are you kidding? i wouldn't miss this for all the tea in china.
i believe somebody owes me ten dollars --
forget about it, kid.  they're ghosts.  let the goddamn yuppie mormon affirmative action assholes handle it.  see i'm almost 55... so i must be senile, right?  they better get me out before i start pissing myself in public.  drooling. it would look bad for the bureau, right?
if evelyn's here, the rest are here!
i believe you'll find everything shipshape, admiral.
let's do something together.. do you want to play monopoly? or careers... clue... snakes and ladders?
i'm sorry, bob.
no, i don't. i'm alone. we all are. especially here. the world's unjust. the respect fools get. the disrespect i get.
oh.
what are my orders, sir?
you're crazy -- it should be like two dollars!
if he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway.
what?
yes, but what does a farmer do if he don't want to get roped in some more by them loan sharks?
no, it requires such absolute precision --
i believe they're laundered and sent to some charitable institution. i don't know what the heck they do with 'em. maybe they use them for dust rags, or pen wipers...
<u>you</u> left me.
it says that you are willing to have the residue of your sentence commuted to the ludovico treatment. alex signs. governor gathers up papers. alex dots the last "i" and smiles.
i'll hang around in here. i'll just be in the kitchen, mom...
you never asked me if i did or not.
there's a dog in the road.
it must have been jarred loose during the whirlpool.
you were hired to look for tom.
i'm sorry, sir.
i don't know nothing.
lynch is giving him the boot... he's not pulling his quota.
if we're going to identify the source of the mutation, we need to isolate your recombinant dna so we can activate positional genomes.
where do i sign, mr. thatcher?
i'd say you were full of shit.
thanks.
well, what?
damn...how much money ya'll got left from the lottery?
big backyards, fences, some hedges, why?
tell me about the last expedition. what was he looking for?
as soon as i saw you loved me, i was pleased, and i gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me, being certain that, for my part, i would never love you.  but after our first kiss, i found that i had no power over myself.  i did not know that one kiss could matter so much.
define that.
what you want me to call you?
doesn't matter. i... i don't want to come back, that's all.
don't wear the beige one.
allright. wait here...
what a guy.
where is his home, lex luthor? which way?
about that luggage.  where's the phone?
uh, right.  a... news story.
uh, yeah... gimme a tab.
yeah, right. you can't get enough of me.
don't ever interrupt me, jerry! just shut the fuck up!
bud.
i suspected as much.
there's got to be an explanation. it could be a magnetic flux or something, maybe the power lines are giving off something.  who knows?  i don't know, i think it's kind of interesting.
not right now, thanks.
no, i don't want to.
god, why is everyone always staring at me?
nothing.
yeah?  say, you're sold on the john doe idea, aren't you?
why don't you buy it, only forty bucks.
see, he's right. i need the cards.  simon, you're broke.
uh -- what?
forget it. you can't even set foot in the parking lot. that's how serious it is.

four days?
patrick? i can't hear you.
holy shit!
i've never run across one like that.
what was that?
put the gun down, alan. i'll take care of them.
there! you see!
it's all connected, pop. it's one life. baseball is memory. how do fathers and sons show their love? they go to a ball game together. thirty-five years later, they sit in the kitchen and remember.
i'll tell you one thing, you won't see me around that alley with that freak on the loose. stay away from his ass - and don't play any of his fuckin' knock-knock jokes.
wake up, william. wake up!
i'm sorry, buddy... i'm sorry...
get up from there. i don't want anybody holding the ends of my pants. get up from there!
why don't we just plug up that tunnel -- with the kommandant on one end and you on the other.
i know how he feels.
where's my baggy pants?
you are asking to burn these people ... you are asking? ... 
i felt limited. i felt confined. i felt like i was suffocating.
it's like hiding from my mother when i was a little girl.
yes.  yours.  you haven't murdered anybody.  you killed mitchell. wasn't that an accident?  it must have been.  if you kill a blackmailer, you kill him dead--so that he can't talk anymore.
so what do you think it was?
no! god, no...
banana cream, pineapple cream, chocolate cream--and apple.
that's because i've been on the wagon.
get out! me too! what are the odds?
let me buy you a drink.
uh... uh...
could you tell me:  did you ever meet your predecessor, dottore fanelli...?
you mean leave the magazine?
you don't tell her majesty how you feel.
i’ve scheduled a medical for you.
you are what...?
didn't have to send me down a fucking mountain.
he's gonna come up with ten thousand, just the way you wanted.
not too good. that's why it states in your contract that if you do not continue to live a normal life, you're in violation and are liable for the station's financial losses. ed, i urge you to reconsider. i urge you on behalf of all those people out there whose lives have become so entwined with yours. play fair with them, ed.
i don't know if this would be a wise move...
oh my god, sir!
no, i'm working too much, i don't have time.
oh yes -- i am -- want to bet?
not like me.  a t-1000.  advanced prototype. a mimetic polyalloy.
maybe that's the price, bud, maybe so. it's gonna be rough on you but maybe in some screwed up way, that's the best thing that can happen to you...stop trading for the quick buck and go produce something with your life, create, don't live off the buying and selling of others...
maybe we should write them a letter?
with your attitude, private, i'm surprised you want to stay in the service.
i believe in you guys.  you are the real shit.  and you know it.  now i'm putting everything i got into this cuz i think we can make it happen, but you gotta put a little in too.  now all i"m asking is that everybody do their part.  we'll move some shit in, and take shifts, or all crash together here --
good night.
why does god let us get tired?
calm down. just listen for a minute.. please.
whose were they?
a little.
no, i just told you what happened.
i don't know.
listen to yourself...  don't worry, it's alright.  we'll find him.  what's wrong with you?
don't put yourself down like that. i <u>never</u> used you.  i worked my way up like a marine grunt!
and so explain it away?  but there is a way to explain it, you see. if i'm mad? that would explain it, wouldn't it?
in a little while i'll help you understand.
still gonna smell it.
yes, i have --
the night is two thousand dollars old.
what is it, your laundry?
do you know when that might be?  we're on the brink of a very serious cash-flow problem.
hello!
my what?
before we go any further here, mr. bond, from lloyds of london, i just want to get two things straight.
it's a bathtub. what she's standing under.
boy, if we were inside, i know how to forge us a group 6 access...
you don't use shit?
compensated...?
you know, maybe you should get some rest --
don't mention it.
let me help you along, martin. you're a sociopath!
then perhaps you need to know me.
sylvan made it up. it's a blow job thing.
his camera... it's still recording.
hurry up! i'm freezing!
mam, it's my truck. i know my own capacity.
loud and clear.
get chewbacca.  try to get around it. i'll draw it away.
downstairs.
the websters!
roy?
i don't think so. not yet anyway. and besides, something like that doesn't make you a bad person. he reminds me of steve in a way. steve's weak, immoral and a liar but he's still a real nice guy. he just shouldn't be married.  at least not to me. you getting hungry? i'm hungry.
roger, i've got it.
maybe you've got a knack for this... i guess we're about to find out.
the north pole is the positive end of the biggest magnet of all - the earth itself!
you could've come.
yes.
just take a look at it. 
looks just like it did.
back to jail in my own car.  ganz got away. got all my money. it just don't seem right.
no.  i'm not.
ditto for the swooping swallow.
you put up a great fight, lion.
i'm not askin', marcie.
the nation will provide for you and the children if anything happens to me.
yeah.
don't worry about it.
romance!
oh, yeah? how'd it go?
uh, i don't have much of an appetite lately.
so you got a girl?
yes?  go on!
i can breathe withour pain now, so i guess i feel great.
no matter how it happened, if she goes ahead and has it" zack, there'll be a child in the world that's mine -- and i couldn't go through life knowing that and not knowing its name or where it lived.
i won't say anything.
um-hmmuhh. i never drink a whole cup, my nerves can't stand the caffeine. ehh-hh, lord awful insomnia in reverse last night. lay there and sweated blood for hours.
because i want someone i can trust.
why goose, whose butt did you kiss to get here?
who are you? hitler's hall monitor?
right.  and when was the last time you spoke to her?
what do they want?
my sixth-grade science project was entitled, “love hurts: the heartbreak of human papillomavirus.” trust me, i’m careful.
who the hell is he?
you'll just have to have faith.
i'm on the brink of bankruptcy; my husband's resources are all but exhausted. and to what end, i ask you?
good.
you say 'fuck' a lot.
at seven-thirty?
look if the truth is you don't feel like talking about this right now that's fine. but don't look me in the eye with a big smile on your face and lie to me. cause there are only so many lies you're allowed to tell before it starts showing on your face.  you wind up looking like...
you's better believe it, brother!
miguel alvarez. we've lived together for nine years.
oh, god! you scared me! yes...
s-ssssstop it!
same old daniel.
and to use the bayonet? pachoie!
do what?
she fucked you?
mm.
we got to get outa here right away. ever'body here? where's uncle john?
nothing. i just wondered. no *reason* to take it up with him.  "--about a quarter of a mile on either side of willet creek--"
buy us some thunderbird, man.
there's not even enough places to stash it in a car.
but i like being human now.
mph rmph rm rmph rm?
i'm writing a book.
you called me. you wanted my help. you know, lenny, i've had more rewarding friendships than this one. although i do get to keep using the same jokes.
i just wanna deal with the boss, ok?
just warmin' up.
ray --
okay, everybody, listen up!
that's what i like about cocktail parties. everyone is so perfectly natural.
good, i hate long waits.
she had a good job, it turned into a great career.
you are a lucky man.  where you come from a man can stand out.  it's expected.  here a man is made to look a fool for standing out.
yeah....? so...jack...are you stroking that big fat fucking cock of yours?
i only have your word for that.
you mean you'd like me to do it, huh?
what?
i'm here.
i don't know how to run a newspaper, mr. thatcher.  i just try everything i can think of.
what are you going to do with your <u>third</u>?
do you think ackland'll sit tight?
things my hear used to know things it years to remember
gilbert!
oh.
why offer a buyoff with your gunmen waiting outside?
we're...
leon, i want to tell you something which i thought i never would say, which i thought nobody ever should say, because i thought it didn't exist... and, leon... i can't say it...
now you know.
muncie!
whaddya mean, buy?
doctor david ravell.
well... hal's reported the ao-unit about to fail again.
sir?
greater than treasure, usul.  we have thousands of such caches.  only a few of us know them all.  when we have enough... we shall change the face of arrakis. listen!...
new ground?
borrowed.  i borrowed it.
you kind of bought yourself a pig in a poke, didn't you, sam? all that time we were first seeing each other you didn't know i was tightly wound--
uh, thanks...
yes, you said.
a bikini! i'll need to buy a new bikini, lex.  c'mon. after being cooped up in that prison, haven't you thought about me in a bikini . . ...once maybe ?
are you open?
are you my friend?
may<u>be</u>. there's kind of a dark horse now in the running.
i got frightened all alone upstairs, so i came down here.
i sent them home. go and call them.
gosh.  gee, lynne... i was just so impressed with your wrestling moves.
you will.
ok, but be careful.
the jaguar's out front. you didn't even bother to put it around back.
why? you're the innocent one.
look jeff, don't louse up my night with another man killer stuffing a grisly trunk that turns out to be --
you've been interfering with my life ever since i met you.  don't stop now.
daddy?
now remember... the first step in avoiding a trap is knowing of its existence.
just a minute.
and you b-believe that.
christ!
airborne. that's where they used to get us agents from. now we get 'em from carnegie-melon, ivy league. accountants and computer whiz-kids. yuppies with guns.  that's scary shit.
is there anything particular you're looking for?
have i? do you know when i come to think about it it's staggering. if i add it all up i must have spent years waiting for signals. imagine! an important part of my life wasted between whistles.
i don't have to go through with it either.
i'd rather wait until it does matter.
plans -- good, plans for tonight or plans for the future?
all right... shoot!  i mean... what's on your mind?
steven??
john's bad.
they're screaming like monsters and it's giving me a headache. go get some fucking starbursts.
hey, okay.
how can you tell?
it's all up to kathryn.  amity's fine with me if it's fine with her.
on the morrow i'll be awake enough to see if dreams come true.
it's not so bad. you may not be able to lie on your back for a few days -- but, then, you can lie from any position, can't you?
what am i -- a dog, now?
you hired me, remember? it's my $10,000. it's my shark...
i'm in love with you!
i don't know. i guess so.
when i grow up, i'm going to go to mhravitch.
hey, come on, big guy like you, cop from new york.  you're gonna be the biggest thing to hit town since godzilla.
have you known this all along?
every time i said it, it was. i never really thought i was going to make it.
now, just a minute—you can't—
why wait?
and marina?  does she have a problem getting out?
stop.
i tell you "officer", it wasn't...
criminal.
and let me guess.  you failed.
what do you want, hun?
there's some buckling on the starboard nacelle.  we've also got a hull breach in the engineering section. emergency forcefields are in place and holding.
bruce may still refuse. it is my belief that he is becoming more belligerent.
nah, that's just tony's way of telling me judge judy starts in ten minutes. you ever watch it?
well, maybe i --
approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back. is this true?
what??
he fell.  he falls.
i don't know. now that we're out here and it's three degrees, i'm not so sure i wouldn't rather face a blood-thirsty mob.
i know.
yep.  well, we started it, he ended it...
yeah?
that's why we won't take the train. cookie showed me where there's a farm house. they got a boat there.
he's not my boyfriend.  i mean, i let him take me out and stuff, but i ain't spoken for.  not yet that is.
i <u>can't</u> call an exterminator.  i can't afford one.  god, i can't even afford my <u>phone</u>.  i got fired.
six weeks of this, and you're surprised you've got freddy in your dreams?  hell, sonny bono says after a while he was seeing his stalker everywhere.  even at mass.
when he went to work, right.
but sir, sergeant wade saved the hostages.
he can take care of himself and i'm not afraid of you.  and you forgot one thing, lieutenant. pierce also taught me how to fuck... can i get you a drink?
are you truly mouthin' off to a senior member of the senate arms committee?  i mean, i'll give you points for style -- just nothin' for smarts.
carter...you ready to have some fun!?
are you trying to excuse our holocaust?
gimme the traveler's checks and the register.
i am you, you little bastard.
well, that's the funny part of it, too, sir.  it doesn't show a damned thing.
there's a pizza welcome lunch in twenty minutes. does that count?
ow.
out - i may be some time
yes, i know. i'm sure it will be a great story.
i'm sorry.  i guess the rest of us have no excuse for wondering where the time went.  it must've been the bars.
i'd like to read it some time.
well, is it?
i have a better suggestion. let's forget that the telephone ever rang. i never heard that you are yakushova... you are ninotchka... my ninotchka...
y-yeah?  well, then it has to stop! because if these bad vibes get out... then everyone will be talkin' about how sick i am, and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, and then -- i'm dead.
so on one you are rich, on another poor. on one you are a murderer, on another the victim.
what about it?
nothing quite as dramatic as that, miss price. he just doesn't eat enough of what is put before him. he suffers from nightmares. i'd think he just needs a hand to hold.
oh, you helped me here, all right, white boy.  you and your goddam memo. you needed to prove your point, uh?
yeah? how?
no, we're here for information, to find out where a man named ricky tan is.  we must tread softly and keep our ears open.
no, i don't think so. she's not afraid of losing her son, you see.  she's only afraid of being abandoned.
is my family here yet?
a tumor - which could cause pressure on certain parts of the brain and, thus, influence your perception.
picard to crusher...
no dipshit, i want you to kill him.
you really want me to put all this stuff back on?
she's with me.
yeah.  i'm okay.  what about you?  i want to know.  about you.  and your mom.
hey jeff. i'm feelin' so much better.
david, nobody's happy in a poodle skirt and a sweater set.  you like all this don't you?
it's her home! it's where she lives!!
an extension on that astronomy paper?  because, uh...
nah, i fucked it up.  i was tryin' to impress this kid, don't ask me why.  i was gonna rescue his old man, but i couldn't find the poor bastard.  he musta blew up.  i got the hell outta there.  i didn't have the nerve to face the kid.
where?
eighty dollars.
yeah, important for your label. which no doubt is why you're in mourning.  don't worry, his records'll sell out now he's dead. you'll make out.
look!
the black capsule. finest kind. thank you, dr. mcintyre.
i didn't ask you to come away with me--
we've already begun.
yeah, i'll bet.
bloom, worlds are turned on such thoughts!
look, i'm desperate. i'll try anything. but what if you can't snap me out of it?
no he wouldn't, i can't go home.
at the roulette table, trying to win enough for our exit visa. well of course, he's losing.
eddie and tinker died.
i don't know.
smell of booze much.
is that so?
boss, some of those men are my neighbors, they know i'm tutsi.
starling -
no.  you're trying to beat me.
come in, dave.  have a seat, make yourself comfortable.  coffee?
mr. rose, i'm in the *doctor* business.  if you want, i can help you. you don't have to go anywhere.
just a minute.  i'm shaking!  take the gun.
aw, get going!
thanks, jack.
go on talkin'. you're talkin' yourself right into the river. go on, go on... .
no! you hate me.  look, i'm gonna do it one time.  that's it.
i shall avenge you --
yeah.
you want to see some?
talk to your new girlfriend.
dreams about killing usually signify feelings of guilt. you had sex last night and you feel guilty.
more than you need me.
people don't do that kind of thing. not in new york.
you don't know.  you don't....
in point of fact it didn't- but i'm convinced the idea is sound.
i'm not in the mood.  even when they're off work, they follow orders.
i'll send it to you at glades.
they knew it.  time, distance, nothing could separate them. because they knew.  it was right.  it was real.  it was...
good day.
who are you?
good morning. what does this mean?
doing what?
your majesty has had many women --
they may have been friends of hers.
how are things in the pimp business, hey sport?
will we...be able to get who ordered it out of them?
all right, gentlemen, i will find it myself. now let's see.
what the hell is that, some kind of porno store or something?
this is great, this gives me hope.  thanks.
get your clothes on, move your butt.
smile.
apparently, fine.  he's coming into work.  that's the good news ...
i'm sorry, dude, but—i—
i don't know.
now, go into second.  little more gas... yeah!  you can get  this whole problem.  now, maybe you downshift to first?
shh.  hide her car in the back!
wait!  calm down, mrs. tasker. there is only one more question.
well, okay.  what's the big deal?  if she'll forget the new fireplace, i'll marry her. just point me in the right direction.
it was krueger, wasn't it?
there's a pizza place over on market.
no offense, whistler, but you're not exactly working with state of the art equipment here. you might have missed something.
let me be taken, let me be put to death. i have more care to stay then will to go. come death, welcome, juliet wills it so. how is't my soul? let us talk it is not day.
well on this one i'd like you to be.
try barney clark.
i don't feel very festive.
got word the kids are moving through texas... i think an ending is being arranged there... come on, lemme see a smile.
ah, but is she richer than mrs. croesus?
sure. go ahead.
you got me, commander.
do you recall my instructions to you, starling? what were they?
i'd really rather take care of it myself.
you've misunderstood.
we can't go anywhere until i get to a phone.
not likely!  where are the speeders?
rake her.
yeah.
that's too bad. i thought a guy like you would appreciate the challenge.
radiation shield, you think?
hm?
i need to make a telephone call.
when i'm bein' fucked, i like to be kissed a lot.  who the fuck are you tryin' to con me into some deal?  you're a city cop, where's the fbi?  this is a federal offense, i got kidnapping, armed robbery, they're gonna bury me!  you know it, you can't talk for them, you're some flunky pig tryin' to bullshit me.  now god damn it, get somebody in charge here to talk to me!
that's because ms. heller doesn't want you to know this whole thing is a scam.
he told me.
yeah, like people in love.
i don't know.
no! no problem, there is no...  what is the problem? just do that... thing... you do! come on! you drove me nuts with this for three days, now do it!
we can always do that, duff.
somethin' was upsettin' you bad last night, and you wanted to tell me and i figured you wanted to tell me so's i could help...
beats me.  ask your mom.
no, please, no, god, no!
hi.
i'm not hungry.
you so do not deserve to be prom queen.
she's in new york.
pull your pants down.
so did dan.
i heard she got straight a's.
the man knew how to dress.
just like that.
where is she?
we have plenty of hares.
well, i am in the construction business, buddy, and without braggin' i have done real good at it.  there are those who wouldn't have expected that out of me.  right now i'm buildin' a giant motel unit near alexandria, outside washington, d.c. not fi-nance, i'm on the construction side.
umm, no.  it's just that --
he tries to act tough, but there's a look in his eyes that... .
you have four seasons, you have four slumps.
you must say that you went to take some of the roses to your father's grave...
were <i>you</i> alone?
no.
krueger's in the real world... maybe he's mortal, like us.
she's gone to moundsville.
one minute -- !
to your husband.
yeah, mack, what is it?
that's wonderful, mom.
i was lookin' at it.  i saw you, man!  jesus!  you oughta see yourself!  you wouldn't believe it.
oh, peter— 
barks his agreement.
i could get a company doctor in twenty minutes.
conflict resolution is my job, laura.
got here as soon as i could.
why did you hang up on me?
the question is weather or not this technique really makes a man good. goodness comes from within. goodness is chosen. when a man cannot chose, he ceases to be a man.
i don't want that chancre mechanic in here.
well i'm just glad you're safe bubba shaina, and eating by your mother for shabos.
okay. i want you to call jennifer and i want you to tell her to tell you what she had for lunch, and i'm gonna listen in on the other line.
leave me alone!!
he likes her better than me.
damn it, look at you!  don't you see what's happening with you?  we need to get out of here, don't you understand?  out of this house!
thank you.
well, this guy i've met runs a hotel. brother. loads of contacts. does a nice little sideline in punting british passports to foreigners. get you a good price.
joe profaci. carlo gambino. vinnie mangano. joe bananas. they all gotta die.
how's the ice?
...yeah.
september 4th, 1993.  about a year after mary disappeared.
good man.  and is she all right?
i want you to stay, okay? i goddam invited you, didn't i?
no.  face it now.  stop thinking it's good guys against bad guys.
if i told you i believe that his happened to my wife, what would you say?
i'll give you a boost.
the - - agility.  you're right!
it's a violent response to something we haven't figured out.  don't let the cowardly demeanor fool you: he is ruthless.  unblinking in his prejudice.
you look familiar ... have i ever threatened you before?
you wouldn't get it. just a private joke between best friends.
look, this isn't my kind of thing!  i wasn't cut out to make little tapestries, or knit little sweaters! i don't do that! i'm a star!
i've had my moments.
what does it mean... climb down to the horseman's soulless place?
harry, what --
i was expecting you. come in.
agatha, you're never going back there.
nothing in moderation, clerval.
don't you like her?
i didn't sell nothing! i didn't sell nothing! i just carried the drugs from the chief to sam.
and i didn't like that man.
need a nurse?
you do a lot of real estate trading, brandon?
but, he said he'd try.
jesus, we're trapped!
you have to leave the white house.
ah, come on hon.  don't be so grouchy.
oh, sing.  sing!
soon, lord vader.
jesus christ, rob.  is that really what's bothering you?
aye, sir.
yes.
this is great!  they're going to start eating each other out there.
you ran eight miles today, puppy.
beholden to none.
if you like -- just hurry!
you love him?
perfect for the mission. nobody else can pull it off - not an army, not a man.
where we headed?
nice lady.
but why is he doing it?
yeah, what - they put some schmuck on tv all day long or something?
colonel, to f-fight you need strategy. to have strategy, ya gotta practice.  and to practice it, ya gotta play --
two?
-- we can't stay here -- i can't stay here -- it's not safe here --
may i have your name please?
hm.  we should do it again.
no.
oh, jesus, really?
you go too far, benedict.
if it makes you and mom feel better, go for it.  i gotta run--
people are dying out there. i don't think "exciting" is the word i'd choose to describe it!
no quarter asked.  no quarter given.
tonight it is.
so what i want doesn't matter?
well--enjoy the natural, honest, unrehearsed result--surgical shock.
what do we have?  are we showing anything?
i have an energy wave from 240 degrees mark six port --
one reason... i want to stay the only one left alive.
oh, i couldn't do that.
you sure?
this is absurd. besides feldman's an allergist. if you're going to do something, do it right.
you trying to tell me how to run my own business?
my brother went here.
you start it off. i don't know anything about it.
yes, everybody <u>is</u> in love with john bubber.  the whole country, in fact. and they're not going to be happy if he jumps to his death because he was harassed by a lousy little money-grubbing low-life fence...
sshhh...
what made it...
the doctor harry used to go to. he was passing just after it happened.
standing room doesn't cost much. i manage.
roger.
enough!
hey, where are you going?
no, i think i will, it's safer. i have patience.
it's alright janet.
clear as day.
but ellen, i told you i have stopped...
working for the district attorney.
i'm... not... nobody...
hey, wait, where's bee-bee? bee-bee! bee-bee, where'd you go? did you guys see where she went?
why?
no. it's ridiculous. this has nothing to do with tom grunemann.
two a year since i was twelve. you do the math.
he was here for four days.
no.
and peter redmond helped immensely. these pauses were exquisitely timed. he made us wait and wait. he built a gorgeous tension and suspense.
thank you.  benjamin --
she thinks i can bring edward back.
i told him you looked like me.
here, tin man -- help me.
hey fuck you damone. there's a lot of girls out there and you mess around with stacy. what have you got to prove?
eighteen... well, i'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
you wouldn't understand.  oh, god, i must be outta my mind. what would your momma think?
you wanna know why?  'cause that mother fucker kennedy stole that fuckin' election, that's why!  nixon was gonna be one of the great presidents 'til kennedy wrecked this fuckin' country.  got niggers all over the fuckin' place asking for their rights, where do you think we got all this fuckin' crime now, 'cause kennedy promised 'em too damned much. revolution comin'.  fascism's coming back.  i tell ya this - the day that communist sumbitch died was a great day for this country.  i jes' hate to think they're blaming it on some silly fuckin' oswald who didn't know shit anyway.  people should know why that sumbitch was killed.  'cause he was a communist.  put me on the stand, go ahead, i'll tell the same goddamn story, i'm proud of it, don't matter fuck all to me, things don't change.
guard barracks.  take some shots.
so what about "michael" then... mr. brooks brothers... mr. bmw.  you still seeing him?
alvy, you're incapable of enjoying life, you know that? i mean, your life is new york city. you're just this person. you're like this island unto yourself.
i did.
that makes him more than a hundred --
and now is definitely not the time to bitch up.
no, it wasn't, it was intentional.
you did? i love him. yeah, you know, i'm thinking of moving to new york.
aye, aye sir. stand by to repel boarders. poop the mainsail. argh, jim boy.
in his inside coat pocket.
it's funny, i've heard of giving up finding a man and raising a family to pursue a career. and i've heard of foregoing a career to start a family-- but i think you're onto something new, selina. "absolutely nothing"-- has a ring to it. i think it could catch on...how's that for sarcasm?
i'm sorry.
maybe i should just go to the bathroom or something.
this just occurred to somebody, now?
holding you... again.
life is good.
on the cervix transfer, you almost lost the t297.
i'd better not, i'll fall right to sleep. i think it's too soon for me to be sleeping with you.
you gonna sit at home the rest of your life? jesus!
i don't know. it's not... seasoned yet. wait. huh. yeah, there's that pink plus sign again. god, it's unholy.
it'll all be over tomorrow. no more wars. no more killin'. just livin' normal like everybody else.  you'll be stuck with me for good.
they can come to the concert in the park.
don't watch.  i can't if you watch.
when lauren was missing the police came to our house. they said they were looking for her, right?  but i know now they had her, and the reason they brought her here and knew the could blame it on you...
you're a starfleet officer and you have a duty to-
how?
it's okay.  i'll be in, in a minute.  look, what do you want?
what are you saying?
nope, can't say that i do.
i'm wet.
if i had it, maybe. but right now i don't have a penny to my name.
yes.
all i did...
no, i'm serious, election's coming up, a lot of people are pretty upset...
she's still a transvestite.
what is that?
look, you're going to have to start trusting me sometime. i am a trustworthy person.
your guests, ma'am?
sure.
very chic.  anyway, you don't have anything else, do you?
it also seems like a problem with the men's attitude, sir.  so maybe you should be sniffing around their shower room instead.
stay calm!
shit!  our armory's a big blue box from the back shelf of stores.  we got about two clips left for an autoloader, and that's it.
so you ain't with the state no more?
that didn't sound very convincing.
what was it, so i'll know.
that'll work.  i just bought one for myself.
could be a lot of things.
well... isn't it great?
could be.
doesn't surprise me. i meet a lot of people like that.
she's punishing me for being honest. i should just go to her house.
yeah... freddy krueger.
mr. chance, the fact remains that we have no information of your having any connection with the deceased.
keep tasting...
what did it do to you?
you're a dead man, macready -- or a dead whatever the hell you are!
but you couldn't have been, could you?
if you can't do what i ask, ray, use that money to go back home, then.
i'm sorry, inspector, i don't know much about..
precinct six. i sent a friend over with bail money.
i'm not. i'm not. i'm just look -- you know, in a way, it's good. he got this out of his system now and he knows it's not worth it and, you know, someday if you guys got married or something --
got here just in time. go ahead. jump in line. maybe you'll win a prize.
have you told him what's happening?
what are you doing? advertising martini?
very popular. are you staying long?
gracious even in defeat. how vaguely disappointing. when all this could have been ours together.
that's nice.
no. no, you definitely cannot do that, mark. that's a big, fat sack of no!
i gotta meet natalie for dinner.
lay off, garcetti.  i'm not in the mood.
that's terrible.
what?
no!  andy, don't do it --
our last game is this saturday.
that's something you'll have to figure out for yourself.  really, peter, you can't expect me to answer such direct questions.

no.
who is it?
agh--
did you just hear something?
fifteen dollars.
who?
murray.
you reached down into death.  now, isn't that right?
the whole idea of god was dreamed up by a silly animal with a small brain called man.  even the limits we put on it are human limits.  it can do this, it can do that!  it designs, it creates!
how long you been at it?
so much the better.
could buy a lot of steaks, 350,000 dollars.
we'll talk about it in the car.
it did give me a chance to meet you again ellen - it's all routine you understand...so where were you?
yes. i don't remember where agnes was. i was needed in the sick room.
well, i think it would be easier if i could talk to you in person.
yes.
that feeling won't last long.
i never was more in earnest.
at dawn, you were born. one eye was closed, and your sister opened it with her thumb. we gave you the sweet drink.
wow... .
no, no, that'll be fine. i don't mind. sure.
you're going to be just fine, harry.

what's that book you've got there?
your card says hutu. take our children, go and get the twins, pay money at the roadblocks. get them out. please.

honesty.
and you notice i'm not in the army anymore.
oh, are you a spy for the other side?
you know,  darling you...you send me...darling you ...you mend me.  honey, sing it for judge tower.
maybe i better start working on him.
no! you can't have me.  kill me.
you can stop looking. there was no coke. i've been in l.a. county with a guy they
i...
where, the mall?
no, we should reach the base of the brain shortly. and from there, it's not far to the site of the injury.
i don't know. it was kind of a dick move if you ask me.
jean baptiste poquelin moliere.
just because it's a love story doesn't mean it can't have a decapitation or two.
little swamp-flu from the conga system. never shook it with all this cryo-sleep.
i'd fucking kill you.
she's not gonna know.
weather's been awful. all those bombs dropping. it changes our weather. sure not like the good old days.
no.
i don't know... too late to stop it.
don't touch him jamie!
you'll be in trouble, son.  now just how do you intend to support your family?
and --?
and her fiancé!  how nice.  i hope you'll be very happy--or is that what one says to the woman?

i think it went on rather too long.
no, i'm not tryin' to fuck you.
okay, george.
you have my word. paul?
it's my control board and i don't want it acting squirrelly because you dropped a few crumbs into the keyboard, no put the shit away.
shut up, hippy.  bud, how you doing?
it's still a very sensitive memory for me.
we'll have a little party. come in. come in. you know herr schikaneder?  this is! a very nice girl.
uh - - anybody else think we shouldn't be out here?
i hit it. i hit it with my cane. then i carry it on the cane and i throw it down to the incinerator, down to the garbage.
if i said yes, then you might think me a norman bates, or a ted bundy type ... and then you might not let me kiss you.
that would be a girl.  i don't even know.
i thought you said she was dead.
i've got to be in washington d.c. in eleven hours for a hearing -- the outcome of which might possibly affect one of the biggest decisions of my life. and here i am standing out in the middle of nowhere texas, chasing phantom tanker trucks.
is there any possibility that it's a hoax? could you be mistaken?
dad!  dad!
god, you're cute when you're mad.
marcie - quiet down! now if anyone is in the closet, come out now --
proximo, we need to talk about my one third... i imagine the betting booths will be doing good business. and, what was the name of that olive oil company?
what about my movie rights?  book rights?
where's sam?
this is my wedding.
a lathe??? get off the line, guy.'
okay, son.
i just don't want to.
a what?
fuck you.
this is so exhilarating!  all week long, i can't wait till sunday, when we sing.
a couple of weeks, i think.
well, it's very easy.  you simply raise more money than you really need.
yeah. you know, piano bars. plays the piano and sings. that's how they met.
you watching the ballgame?
he's going to be dropping bombs on mandalay! they're going to be shooting at him!
no it's not. guys name their penises.
i'm sorry.  i have to bring you to a cell.
maybe.
sounds like another slime job ... no, they're all right.  they're here now ... right ... let me know.
i don't have what they want, harry.  harry, will you tell me something? how can i keep making movies when people in the streets are starving?
go on--give 'em to your friends.
ya know, i'm thinkin' -- with another income coming in, i would love to get a bigger place.
oh... god... am i cold...
yes, of course.
yes... i'll give you that.
i don’t think so. this is going to be a better life for all of us, honey.  we’ll put annie and josh in private schools...
yeah i saw 'em around.  they worked vice.
that's not the fucking point, whether you told the truth or not! hello...?
no... no, it's just that i should get going in a few minutes, and --
you already went back to work.
so where to on the honeymoon?
you know what i mean...
that's not good enough, goddamit!
anything.  anything.
where's craig?
you *couldn't*?
what do you mean?
and then?
even assuming you're correct, mr. spock, why would they fire on their own president?
it's just a thought.
what?
and what is that?
nothing but a wide world o' pain locked in there.
you murdering dog!
we've got to get rid of it! there's been a balls-up somewhere, and when the music stops they'll jump on whoever's holding the cheque!
remy.
if you don't, i'll come after you. and i won't let you off so easy.
that way.  you?
i don't like being referred to as babe, or addressed as baby. i don't like your possessive attitude, nor your hints of secret knowledge. in fact, to be very frank, mr. mitchell, i don't think i like you.
the dead can wait.
yeah, you know. suffers from one of these complexes they have nowadays. seems pretty obvious, doesn't it? she's probably very unattractive and bitter about it.
without raziel we'll never find tir asleen.  we'd better go.
that's funny.
justice already knows.  talk to me, john.  tell me what's happening?
joanna loves this play. she has sunk tons of money. she is completely ncommitted.
very good. very good. the mets are gonna win tomorrow.
copy.  hal, tell gabe he only makes advances <u>to me</u> or else he'll be walking down four thousand feet, and sleeping outside.
i love this guy! 
i've never ridden in an automobile.
what about jewelry?
that was a pretty good escape act at the station.  how did you do that?
brenda, are you okay? come sit.
i think that’s disgusting.
truce?
we'd be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.
okay. i'll take two guys off.
i know.
all right, master mind.  but there's something cockeyed about that joint and i'm going to find out what it is. 
it's grandmother style.
any idea when she'll be back?
keep the light up.  i can't see.
where?
who?  oh.  my friend.  my friend is laura.  a girl.  a friend who's a girl.
what?
i'm honored to know this man.
you're beginning to sound like mr. kirkeby already.
yes.
biederman, yes.
you're saying no.
and if you didn't believe me?
huh. i’d have thought a tough guy like you would know better. the sick ones are out there, friend. they make up the clientèle. get rid of them and we’re out of business.
shit and fried eggs.
oh, don't be too discouraged. for aesthetic appreciation - always a little time.
i'm sending simpson to take over for you, the division is going to caen, you're not coming with us, i have something else for you.
was she ill before that girl came into your household?
there are two halves of the force of others.  one is positive and will help you if you learn how to use it.  but the others half will kill you if you aren't careful.  this negative side of the force is called the bogan, which is where the expression came from, and it is the part that is used by the dark lords to destroy their opponents.  both halves are always present.  the force is on your right, the bogan is on your left.  the kiber crystal can amplify either one.  the crystal darth stole was the last one in the possession of the jedi.  when he joined the sith, the power of the dark lords was completed.
and you think he'll...
don't worry if the old lady's there i'll brick it back up.
i don't know anything about it.
no. i won't talk to you where you can use your hands on me.
we're gonna get laid, baby.
i'll call you tomorrow.
i told walter.
a jerk.
he's a good man.
means you keep me using my head, and that's good!
how long?
since four.
uh-oh.  i mention marriage, all of a sudden...  ve <u>haff</u> to ta...
none of the servants is to touch a gun!  you know that!
because i am the director.  don't you realize, if it wasn't for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now.
had some good years.  met her in '66.  she showed up one day in coldfoot.  no one knew her.  one sunday morning, she marched into a bar and announced she was available as a wife to the highest bidder.  didn't work out in three months, she'd return the money and leave, no hard feelings.  my bid was eight thousand dollars.  beautiful girl.
--drew, he's your dog. are you listening to this?
i haven't got any new stories for them this morning, either.
tell 'em we'll have pie and punch.
over half-million dollars worth of merchandise.
they're all the same, but each one is different from every other one. you've got your bright mornings and your dark mornings. you've got your summer light and your autumn light. you've got your weekdays and your weekends. you've got your people in overcoats and galoshes, and you've got your people in shorts and t-shirts. sometimes the same people, sometimes different ones. and sometimes the different ones become the same, and the same ones disappear. the earth revolves around the sun, and every day the light from the sun hits the earth at a different angle.
no . . . not the artful postures of love, but love that over- throws life. unbiddable, ungovernable, like a riot in the heart, and nothing to be done, come ruin or rapture. love like there has never been in a play.  i will have love or i will end my days as a . . .
i think so.
look jack, in my experience the best way people deal with this is to just relax and breathe through it...let it come to you.
no.
well, don't preach wisdom to me. you talk about him as if he had occasional bad manners.
i wouldn't live in it as a ghost. now watch . . . right on the second floor there.
i have not spoken to him...
that's it. that's it. breathe easy.
they are here. i know they are. listen for something that doesn't make a sound.
it?  who does?
okay.
it's reptilian.
because you're afraid!
...until our wedding night. when our bodies will join.
they can't pull this on me. it isn't fair--i don't believe this--
got it.
yeah, ok.  i found the first licorice comfits album at vintage vinyl.  the one on testament of youth.  never released here.  japanese import only.
no, you tell her.
<u>this is ceti alpha v</u>! ceti alpha vi exploded six months after we were left here. the shock shifted the orbit of <u>this</u> planet and everything was laid waste. <u>admiral</u> kirk never bothered to check on our progress. it was only the fact of my genetically engineered intellect that enabled us to survive! on earth, two hundred years ago, i was a prince, with power over millions -- now, like prometheus i have been left by admiral kirk to digest my own entrails.
it's me. what is it?
ah, yes, our paul, strong and silent and very sad -- quite the byronic character. perhaps i ought to cultivate it.
that's what respectable folks do. get a job, get married, start having babies. that's what you want, isn't it?
but going in that church, i'd be stooling for you, charley. you make a pigeon out of me.
and who's this susan when she's at home?
new hitman wants to leave his mark
marty...
he's flying to sicily. his mother's dying.
y-yeah. gee, doggone it, i never thought about that. gosh!
do you think this is a wise course of action?
aren't you going to watch them? they'll get away!
-- leo wasn't killed here. he was dumped here. out of a vehicle. bald tread. muffler held on with baling wire.
david --
it means i'm gonna shampoo my hair and stay out of your way.
ethan hunt.
home.
helllp!
guess.
it was good.
oh, my god!  i can't recognize the face, but the butt does look vaguely familiar. 
how did you know my name was sarah?
merde!
integrity - acute, like indigestion.
that could be possible...
great.  i'll see you at the office at nine.
there aren't.
are you drunk?
what's the larger experiment?
i don't think i've had that pleasure.
tip top, willie...tip top.
i'm one of the proofers.  i slipped the article in.
york ave.
i'm not touching my film...
is she as pretty as you?
we played with a code using <u>the new</u> <u>york times</u> obituaries.  over three years we played twelve matches.  i never won.
i don't know.
i'm all right...
i meant did you find other stuff to --
who are they, sir?
i have one now.
what about a loan?  you could go to the bank...?
mary came with me.
i wasn't singing to myself.
i dunno. it was right here. someone musta' boosted it back...
there was no ad in the times.
forget it.  you can't prove it. sister's testimony is no good. jury knows we win she gets the cash.
yes, we will.
no, my dear, he is a federal agent.  he killed two of my colleagues the other night.
ruined a brand-new pair of lee press- ons.  well, i sat down for a beer and ka- blewey! next thing i know, somethin' blows through my kitchen window. next thing i know, i'm ass up in loretta's flower bed.
berry spoons.
james cole.  that's everything we got.  none of the james coles on the computer match him. no license, no prints, no warrants.  nothing. you want me to go in with you?
you drive a hard bargain, but i had a feeling you were my boy when i met you.
two lumps, madame?
right.
i warned you!
how do you get through those winters?  well, you're right.  juneau.  what's the highest peak?
yes.  i care about you.  i did it for you.
why don’t you ask when i left the mondrian?
what? that's disgusting!
hi, adam.  this is, uh....
anne schuyler, are you going to sit there and watch this man insult us? haven't you any decency left?
you fuck!
i don't know.  just promise me one thing.
how many?
somewhere in utah.
oh, jesus, they've stopped.
yeah, man, my manager and my lawyer.
but she's standing right next to you.
i suppose my reluctance was the group aspect of it -- i've never been much of a joiner, although i still consider myself a somewhat religious person --
i gotta work off some of this adrenaline. i got a line on this pawn shop guy over in brooklyn. anybody want in?
yeah, why not, because we're just gonna go home later, right?
i think you're right, keith.
no... no thank you notes.
yes.
my client is prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets.
i'm leaving and don't even call me when the shoe falls 'cause all he did for me was to try and run my life. i'm tired of people saying babe brother this, babe brother that. what's my name?
i didn't see my prednizone.
since you put it that way.  it's hard for me to refuse.  ...have a, i have a terrific problem with authority, you know. i'm... it's not your fault. don't take it personal.
let's get outta here, honey.
no.
we're going to finish that gin game.
it's ... incredible.
yes, it is.
pretend, darling.  it's all soul's eve.  round about the fire we go...  over the flames we leapt
he's doped to the <u>gills</u> ...
i can't see a thing.
he'll replace you, too- that's all you really care about.
pierdo.
well, that's blunt!
why, yes, to you, mr.--mr. --what?
look, she wasn't a relative, okay? i don't know who she is.
i want you to know, when you left spectre it opened my eyes. there was a whole life out there that i was not living. so i travelled. i saw france, and africa, half of south america. every day a new adventure, that's my motto.
thank you.  thank you very much.
i can't!
no.
but it's a small room, jason.
where's my information?
big show in the parade grounds this noon -- some boss stuff --
splendid, love to see them.
why don't you just drive a stake through my heart?
no, verbal. you weren't friends. keaton didn't have friends. he saved you because he wanted it that way. it was his will.
how can you find somebody without knowing what he looks like?
rick, i really think i'm in love.
we live in a theater?
my darling.
... what's going on?
paul, can you hand me the olives? ruth, i need you to, what was it?
we're not cops.  we're from massachusettes.  i mean, does he look like a cop?
not much more.  big day in the big city.  what's on your mind?
what was your name again?
i'll try...it's what the don would want us to do.
i'm gonna get that fucking bandleader, colonel. no deal. no fucking deal.
you're the waterfront specialist. find out about it.  i've got a murder to investigate.
what's up, sidra.
of <u>mercy</u>...off...

n-o-o-o-o-o-o....
oh, don't be silly.
really?  with a name like von <u>doom</u>? never saw <u>that</u> one coming.
must have been? used to live? i do live here.
why not?
i'm so tired of you running that. i always worked hard for you.  you think i'm a leech, a kling-on, i quit.
where's clifford?
our friend, poseidon, didn't use it for fishing. he raked the sea with it and stirred up the big waves.
okay, tell you what: i'll get her number for you just as soon as she gets back from japan.
epps.
i think someone hasn't.
how're you doing?
oh, you...
for a while.
look. those kids are still trick-or- treating. they're still out.
we're hoping you're going to help us figure that out.
he's not what i expected. he's very -- he's so -- happy.
i've had time to get over it.
you turned around!
why would she be hiding from me?
are you detective williams?
it's a knocking-shop. tres discreet, huh? he visits his ladies on tuesday and thursday nights and saturday mornings. his security's in the car beyond.
phil collins? are you sure he isn't drinking and driving?
so, relic, you want to open pandora's box, do you?  see all the mysteries exposed?
no. i wanted to do it without saying anything. i think he's worth it.
ed, it was only one review.
that's all i ever wanted!
look, that's temporary, believe me. there's so much shit gonna hit the fan the next few days, my getting fired by lariviere and merritt won't matter a bit.
let's wait and see how you survive your first crisis, rocky ...
what was in the 'miami herald' and the 'times.'  confessions?
you big, fat sonofabitch, if it weren't for me, you'd still be sitting in the file room where i found you.  and you... nena... you've still got needle scars from where i pulled you out of.  you of all people...
there's three thousand and if you don't come through, i'm going throw you clean out of that window. deal?

it's pulling me deeper!
he didn't know nothing. and nobody. except her, from when they was at that place baby suggs was at.
a doctor?
jesus... this is inhuman.  uh... i wasn't told of any operations in this area. they shouldn't have been here.
don't take any chances. shoot through the desk.

that's right. will you see that mr. sheldrake gets it?
what i saw the other night, i didn't dare believe, betsy --
don't you read shakespeare?
dying?
you're very smart, joey, very smart. nobody gives me a straight answer around here. you're givin' me these answers, but you still didn't answer my question. did you fuck vickie?
oh.
yes -- he mentioned it.
cynthia, i don't think you want to, i mean, you should see the way he dresses. i really think he's in a bad way.
hi, sweet stuff.  good news.
ahh.
have you found your man? is that where he is?
and our assets?
so the truth is more important to you than your life?
without me.
what do you mean?
so you can't tell me anything?
yes!
i'll see you back soon. there's an extra pair of glasses in your black socks, and there's some suntan lotion and blistex in your kit.
no... i've got to go to mr. underhill...
fine.
i don't care. she's always been neutral in politics and that's not going to change.
they are...it happened in tonight's quake.  it happened just fifteen minutes ago. you must've felt it.
all right, all fucking right, i am coming.  willie, he doesn't know you are here, just sort something out, ok.
he's not in, mr.?
...and one day, this sweet girl calls me, asks me to lunch. just a shoulder to cry on deal. one thing leads to another and before i know it --
but, i'll take some of that nyquil... you know it puts you right to sleep no matter what's wrong, you go right off...
for christ's sake, shut up--
is... is it... loaded?
don't rush me, okay? you're jumping to conclusions before i've even said anything.  and besides, it's not for me.  it's for our daughter.
what's that?
nicholas...
will you stop riding me?!
their child died, and they got a lawyer.
what are we going to do with...
now that's what i call plain crazy -- internal combustion is just too dangerous, all those little explosions, never catch on.
cabana one.
yes, of course... well, it's been a pleasure meeting you, mr. merrick. good day.
motherfucker... you stay away...
are you listening to me?  you're involved in this!  i want to go to the police and tell them i was mixed up in this thing tonight?
i didn't think so.
five million dollars will buy a lot of rolaids.
figure they split?
what?
marcus, i'm tired. that's all.
well, okay, but i just want to look at the facilities. that's all.
he can't hear you. he's just a deaf and dumb indian!
i am going to call the police now.
you have beautiful things.  how much is this?
....i hardly <u>think</u> so... after "the incident"...
swell--you've got times square right here--all but the noises--
anything *better* to offer?
sure you do.
...then...
me too.  make any headway with "zorro"?
what do you want with those two medical officers?
look, i'm no expert, but--
but, if the farm is not mine, who stole it away?
i'd better call sylvie -- she must be frantic.
i'll try. i've been wanting to go to baker for a long time. i've heard a lot about it.
sam's favorite.
who?
you're forgetting the check for your suitcase.  it's at the grand central.
i'm not a puget deb. i hate that goddamn term!
i've got one chapter guizot thinks is terrific. "caviar and blood." swana escapes over the ice!
what's wrong?
we aren't going to have a war.  we're going to have the "appearance" of a war.
i don't wanna hear anymore about it, you hear me?
shore it is. it always is, this time a year.
meet me at three.
what are you talking about? he had no more to do with it than you did.
fixing my roof.
perfectly all right. i do not like boots.
judy, i want to tell you: these few days have been the first happy days i've had in a year.
huh?
some public relations guy got a hold of a tape of an interview... where you're saying you were on the american judo team in the olympics...?
look, jeffrey, i don't want a partner. in fact i don't want the father to be someone i have to see socially, or who'll have any interest in rearing the child himself.
wish i could help, sheriff.  but if you'll excuse me i'm going over to harlin's to pick up my car.  then i'm getting the hell out of this place.
i do not speak english.
i came to see you safely out.  check for yourself.
nuh-huh ...
i lied.
they won't let him die.

i told them what you said -- about this man being carson dyle's brother. i asked them what they knew about it and they told me -- you're not gonna like this, mrs. lampert -- they told me carson dyle has no brother.
kennedy's a catholic. he'll never win.
reed. even you can't compute every little thing.
i've handled sharks before. bigger than this one.
i'm glad you feel that way, because i feel that way, too.

that's okay. that's his style.
there's love and there's behaving like you do because there's nobody to tell you not to.
worse since she talked to him.
he won't even know you're there. he is delirious.
we're moving.  i've been looking for a job but it's been... hard. my name's been in the papers too much. sometimes i wonder if reporters understand how much pain they can inflict in just one sentence. i'm not thinking of myself. but my wife, my parents, it's been very rough on them.
in a manner of speaking.
i think falling in live with movie stars is something that happens to a man as he gets older.

susan broke her ankle last night at the ice rink  rachel?

no.
why can't you come...
i'm having some people over for drinks right after the races. why don't you all come over? then about nine, ten o'clock we can play.
i don't know. why don't you ask them sir.

oh, swell. you know, mr. connel said that if things keep going the way they are, i might be seeing that promotion sooner than i thought.
this is the kinda mistake can take a hindu's lifetime to unfix... you better get a move on, johnnie, before that boy got her holdin' down a memphis streetcorner and shootin' dope up her arms.
how low?
i understand you just moved here?
so am i. but where's my money?
yeah, well it's simple for everybody else - give 'em a big mac and a pair of nikes and they're happy! i just can't relate to 99.9% of humanity.
doctor?  what could be wrong wit' you?
a month at most, that's all i ask.  elizabeth, please. things have not yet resolved. i must take steps to see that they do. for our family's sake. for our sake.  you are life itself. we shall seal our vow. the moment i am done.
i'll stay out with you tonight, doctor, just on the chance that you're right. and if you are right, damn you for letting him out.
i guess. he went to the garage. poor thing, he's probably never seen such a crazy mess. he probably wants to go back and live in mr. cox's shop.
you didn't know that at the time!
no, no, fax is -
two terms; one in italy, one in the united states.  he's known to the government as a top narcotics man. that could be a plus for us; he could never get immunity to testify.
that's more than you already owe me. what happens if you fuck this up?
what were you doing there? you never told me you were singing with an r and b group.
would you?  because if you couldn't, i would be very lonely... i would have left the only world i know and have known since i was seventeen.  but none of this will happen.  so it doesn't matter.  because we are on the guajira peninsula.  and all you see around you...look around... is archangel de jesus montoya- londono.  he is my man.  and you are a smuggler moving a load...
yes, you are. you're protecting somebody. now listen, it doesn't make any difference who it is. it can't be as important as this. now come on, tell me. where were you last night?  come on, don't be a fool. matt, you trust me, don't you?
it might have worked.  really.  i would have been delighted for you if it had.  but she wasn't interested.  not my fault.
well, she's my mother, not yours.
oh. i'm sorry. gideon, what do you say?
well who the hell verifies that ?
yeah. where they gonna whack us?
guess so.
i know -- i know -- but it will be sunny in tremezzo. we'll have a guest then.

is it, jerry?  you ask those three pour souls up in brainerd if a deal's a deal! go ahead, ask 'em!
her name was elizabeth.
yes, mrs. dreyfuss. he starts out with a worried backward glance toward the two. fran is just sitting there, the spoon in her hand, not touching the soup.
how can i believe it when you don't even know who the killer is? i've got that right, haven't i? you don't know who did it.
never before this.
i'm not talking about the fucking church. fuck the church. but tell me. do you believe in god?
don't joke.  they might.  so do me a favor and behave yourself for once.  ed masry to see kurt potter.
despite you.
well, when you're used to the raw power of iggy and the stooges, everything else sounds kind of precious by comparison.
you're telling me.

you were the only sullivan in the phone book.

and yet you would have killed him to save my life.  you have a sense of honor, vincent, that i can't even remember anymore.  i don't know that i ever even had it to begin with.  all i know to do, vincent, is to finish my job.
elaine, what's going on?
i like the sport the way it is.
what feelings?
she didn't say she had no man.
never.
ben, are you there?
you're right... okay, you're right.

i don't care what anybody calls me, joe. long as it ain't to dirty. and if you fellas get together every year and say, "charlie, we still want you to run things for us", i ain't gonna insult ya by sayin' no.
we paid attention in school.
i don't know.
seventh, files section.  what should i do?
oh my god!
what is he being charged with?
really?
sam! quite a do the other day. it meant a lot to folks that you said something.
whoa, whoa!!  think it through!  i'm the only one knows where they are. just let me talk for a second.
where had you been before?
is this an gritty exposé or a candy ass press release?
yes. shall we start on it right now-- or order dinner first?

why not?!
well maybe she better start.
right here!
what teacher?
when will the stream be aweary of flowing under my eye? when will the wind be aweary of blowing over the sky? when will the clouds be aweary of fleeting? when will the heart be aweary of beating, and nature die?
a huge law firm. okay? they put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb. franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'you must drop by with pat and me...' okay...?
alvy, i can't say that that's true at this point in my life. i really just can't say that that's true. i mean, you know how wonderful you are. i mean, you know... you're the reason that i got outta my room and that i was able to sing, and-and- and, you know, get more in touch with my feelings and all that crap. anyway, look, i don't wanna- listen, listen, listen, uh  h'h, so whatta you up to anyway, huh?
really?
hmm... mike and ike's.
did you think i could just leave you...?
a poet. he's sitting right over there. that's his table —— the one at the feet of dante.
right.
she's a local. when the dudes come out to new mexico, they went to wallow in latin glamour. this is a bad town for blondes.
as much as for a lord?  what an honor!  did your king give you other wealth apart from horses?
i'm tellin' you, those cops been fuckin' wit your mind. they turn black against black, that's how they do.
you did the same to your god!
don't worry about it. i'm not gonna do anything. what am i gonna do? i'm especially not gonna involve you in anything.
yummy.
when you could've found one in america.
more or less.  only for the end i've got a gimmick that's real good.
why can't we have pot roast or stroganoff or even a little london broil? i mean, for god's sake, we own a grocery store!
yeah. most important day of my life. whatever. listen, i chose you to be my maid of honor for a lot of reasons: i love you, you’re my favorite, and only, half-sister, blah blah blah. but the main reason i picked you is because you’ve been so miserable for the past few years, i knew you wouldn’t outshine me.  but here it is, my big day. my big day. and something doesn’t feel right. maybe it was that pep talk you gave me last night, i don’t know, but your misery just isn’t working for me anymore.
you did. yesterday you said, and i quote, "i have a date with roger from op/ed tonight and i'm going to do it with him."
please. please listen to me. if you knew what really happened, if you only knew the truth --
and you're taking?
right!
so are you!
yessir.
i'm trying to keep balance with --
thass right. just play it...
my little sanctum is at your disposal. but i don't think i understand -
i will keep you safe. we are both older.
i sincerely doubt it.
a wormhole with an einstein-rosen bridge, which is, theoretically... a wormhole in space controlled by man.
terrible for her, but think about me, young boy with that kind of power. wasn't three weeks later that the crow came back to me in a dream and said, "your grampa is going to die." well, i ran right back to my parents. my father said, no, gramps is fine, but i could see there was trepidation. and true enough, that next morning my grampa was dead.
you the owner here?
the mary is in deference to the holy mother, the clarence in honor of saint clarence loyola.  there are three vows that every nun must accept.  the vow of poverty...
it's a week.  we didn't know where you were - or if you coming back, or -
no.  this is my lawyer, samuel sutherland.  i thought you two should meet.
chief, it's mikkelson.
come on!
vat?
i can't, dummy. he'll see that the pack's been opened. you're such a dumbhead.
of course i haven't got a nose.
nothing matters.
they're okay and it's worth it. ain't it?
no, not anyone else - just me.
hi there.
listen to andy, sean.
mickey told me to come back to work.
dead.
oh, that one. that's me grandfather.
deal's changed.
so...
i want you to come in till i get the lights on.
blue moon...
clean up?  i don't...
you're cold?
so why don't you give me a jingle in the year 2000?
i don't think the dead much care.
they still have to take it to a jury.
there you go again. stop saying that. you can make it.
they told her something, but it can't have been too specific, cause i talked to her, and she sure didn't think her water was bad.
n-no!  not exactly, i mean you take years and years...
okay... maybe that would be best.
mayo, zack mayo, sir!
her parents died in an accident. i don't care what else she's written.  what are you -- a book critic?
int. tunnel - day.
is morally, ethic'ly
right here, ben.
what do you want me to do for you, mr. stephens?
yeah?
flo, i'm just gonna help myself to a refill on the coffee.
bad?
what?
it is morning.
you get much of that in here?
that's a nice name for what you need...
do ya good.
i know. i don't either.
some guy in california. his name is redfoot.
no luck? well, milk and orange juice'll do quite nicely. quite nicely.
who has?
i told you twenty!
i'll do it again, i'll do it again, i'll do it again!
i'd say at least eighteen hours.
they're all dead...dead, i tell you.  ahhhh, we're all deaaaddddd. tyrellll, joinnnn usss.
why?
they gotta stop sayin' that.
i thought we would meet alone.
yes!
don't do this, don.
sixty days?
i have no idea.
he jumped. down there.  he's dead, cuervo. i did it. i killed plissken.
i don't know. no, not really i suppose. but i've made a prudent judgement that it meets the conditions set down in the ritual.
hell, yeah. i like it cold. colder the better.
i don't know.
see that spot?
probably the caffeine.
it must be one o'clock.
for the time being, i imagine that must do.
he wasn't even in the car?
i get it. this is the part that's best for both of us. don't do me anymore favors, eh ?
i'm not going.
it's got to be here.  i heard him talk about it.  he bragged about it. six steps out, three left.
and smooth, boy, you are smooth.
you can call me oz.
how do you know you can trust me?
what view?
aren't you afraid somebody could steal your car like that?
you're a lucky man, all right.
do you always look at it encoded?
once a week you like a gentleman?
oh.
i guess so.
this is bigger. seven years to the day. no blackouts.
who put my client in the hospital for life.
well, i'd make an exception in this case if i were you.
the photos.
quite simple. yes. good.
i was not informed about observers.
what do you mean?
neither do i!
yeah.  but i wasn't there for a second.
every tom, dick, and harry thinks he can write. but a journalist gets in there, right where the bombs are. he's aggressive. grabs the bull by the balls.
that must have made you proud.
a puppy's got a little more personality than a fish.
that doesn't make sense, mrs. hill. we have the man that killed the president.
in the cellar, i think. wait, i'll take care of it.
sorry.
who's the other wrestler? the one with the mustache?
the video cameras will put you with him in the bank, and i'll bet there were enough witnesses.
i think i already have.
it sounds to me like everybody's just a little jumpy. and since all it is is a drop, the welshman's got nothing at stake. i say we go to his 'troughed off' bar. it'll calm his nerves, we drop the bag, and we all get back to our lives.
well, why did you promise me you wouldn't fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works?
oh, i know.
but i'm always afraid i'll say something stupid.
what?  he gonna record you on his label?
remember our friend healy? well, i didn't know where to mail his last paycheck so i sent my assistant by his mother's apartment. turns out there is no diabetic mom. landlord said she's been dead for ten years.
senator martin...! you can't trust jack crawford or clarice starling. it's such a game with these people. they're determined to get the arrest for themselves. the "collar," i think they say.
go back to your quarters  that's an order.
ann, when would i have told you? we were not speaking, if you recall.
actually, i saw the greenhouse. so i thought... i thought i'd come out here and take a look at it. you don't see one of those every day. it looks like heaven...
and nobody will make fun of your horrible deformity.
why?
i don't know.
it could have been a squirt gun.
well, after a thing like that you wouldn't be expected to.
i'll tell you something, doc. one day you're going to have to trust somebody...
then why weep for him?
your hair's a little funny.
well, you don't wanna trust me too much. we'll take ned his share together so you don't figure i run off with it.
 my two friends have my share of the money.  i'll have to speak to them after we deliver these to the wholesaler.
adrian, i'm asking you nicely, in the name of all that is good: release my friends and get in the flask.
let him go, stan. i can help.
you think the three in the tank come from a test tube?  they're merely the ones who survived.
i've done nothing. this is who they are. didn't you know that?
oh, but he doesn't do it every day -- just once or twice a week.  and he can't catch her old cat, anyway. and now she says she's gonna get the sheriff, and --
a what?
yeah. summer vacation. thought i'd travel some. maybe write a little bit.
after we've completed our investigation.
sure thing.  look, i've got enough, between your preliminary statements and all the witness accounts.  you can go home.  gimme til morning.  find out who he is. until then, don't sweat it, huh?  just your random bad cheese trying to hole you.
it does look good.
you were with him?
look... you... take her and get the hell out of here. i'll keep 'em busy.
ms. marr!
what do you want for it?  two thousand? three thousand?
speakin' of moans my stomach is startin' to growl.
yeah.
you're a married man, am i right?
no dad.
i want to sleep here tonight.
every word of it.
would you like a drink of water?
i committed no war crimes.
what, darling?
trying to have a relationship with you, max, is like standing in a fog bank.  you know you're in the middle of something only you have absolutely no idea where you are.
i seen the bodies before they sealed 'em up. them fellas sizzled up good. looked like some shit from the x- files.  damn, that shit's nasty.
not my choice of toast, but it's your call. to your triumph over annette.
what was that all about?
so we got a plan?
well, maybe one.
yes, i believe i do.
give him the tampon test.
i wadn't thinkin' about nothin' else just like you told me i'd do.
waitaminit, dudes! i got it! we find four really small kids, beat the shit outta them and steal their tickets. what do you think?
no thanks. i don't drink.
you're done, come down, and let's...
'cause he's comin' back, that's what for. frank's got you really loaded tonight.
but vince has contacts all over the place!  this is san francisco!  they'll be looking for me!
on the telly.  we're to film him for the evening news.
sorry.  my pajamas are tailored. would it be too distressing to continue with the towel?  no more immodest than a kilt, you know.
we can get to work on that oil!
where it can do the most damage.
why did you change your name?
yeah, i'm gonna start sleeping here.  masry & vititoe, can i -- damn it.  does anyone know anything about these phones?
frank -- what are you doing here?
'strapped?'
we've fused into a major series, ross. this girl isn't the second victim. this is "jennifer <u>eight</u>."
what about you? you haven't eaten in days. how come you're never on this side of the microscope?
you lied to me?
no.  it's the truth.  i know what you are.  like me, like bain, you're a ghost, you're not part of the real world.  you don't have a social security number.  you don't pay taxes.  you've probably used ten different names over the last ten years.  a long time ago something probably happened, something illegal and you ran, you disappeared and it was easy.  you think you can do it again.  but i'm telling you, fading from the law is nothing.  no matter what you do, where you go, i swear to you that bain will find you.
that's fine with me...  get it? fine. a fine! hey c'mon, c'mon, what is this, an audience or a jury?
am i afraid of them?  not during the day.  sea snakes are diurnal.  when the sun's out, they don't bite. fortunately for you, i had on my watch.  this is quite good.
and to you, mr. andrews.
that is for me to decide.  i need to talk to her mr. riley, she is a key element in this case.  i have a press conference in an hour, and i need to explain why there are four dead celebrities.
don't start no trouble, boy!
i've regretted it ever since. never run with the herd just because they're the herd.
it can't all be like this...
absolutely. be good for you to talk to him.
so you say.
will ye do somethin' for me if i ast you to?
don't jack with me.
what does he see?
in any event, my feelings were hurt when i learned that he had fallen for someone else. someone chaste... pure... innocent.
until we're out of the mine field is how long.
i dunno -- she fills gaps.
logging? we'll need an environmental impact study for that...
you don't understand, i can get us information...
yeah! boobs. heh heh. i just wanna say that again. boobs. heh heh.
i'm okay... i'm okay.
give it back to him.
when this is over, i owe you a drink.
- the family jewels?
we want ... a shrubbery!
we'll get into that later.
you've always called before, always.  now i'm not asking what you did, i just want to know that you're alright.
inspired, ms. ivy.
you know something? you should've written our insurance policies for us because you got more exclusion clauses than double indemnity. what do you imagine people thought? the berlin philharmonic's taken over by doctor goebbels and his propaganda ministry but wilhelm is a freelance, so art and politics are now entirely separate? is that what you believed ordinary people thought?
i had my fingers crossed when they swore me in, but i'm going to tell you the truth. there are things in this world that go way beyond human understanding, things that can't be explained and that most people don't want to know about anyway.  that's where we come in.
ruth's already taken him home.
it's in the transcript. what does it matter now?
i don't know, honey.
well.  what seems to be the...?
what's the big deal?  you decided to pretend you were me.  a little moment of weakness, right?  so i sorta swiped her purse.  i got feet of clay too, buddy.
pups. bitches. from three to twelve months.  trained and untrained ones. white and brown ones. you understand?
fantastic.  out here.
of course it does. if we believe that birds are attacking, why... why next we'll believe that grasshoppers and cockroaches are capable of...
i mean, at least bo's invested in three of my movies.
it's not worth it. you pay too big a price. it's never free.
no.
because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount.  two hundred ten thousand.  that would mean i keep seventy.
how long is temporarily? i trust not until july.
i'm not sure.
...yes you heard me... don't ever call back here again.
have the child taken to bed.
he's feeling wonderful.
she's really cute and she's really nice.
look!
you're talking like boris karloff! it's movie dialogue!
you fucker, don't you ever touch lula - you fucker, i'll kill you.
hey, let's get something straight. if i'm gonna die, i'm gonna die, but you're always gonna be the asshole, so just shoot, alright.
stand by, bird dog.
no.  you, i told them, you can't betray with the picture what you're saying with the words.  and, i don't know, the movies, i don't know.  they should be socially uplifting, why does she have to show her br...what is this...?
tell me about him.
what they all want -- to handcuff a hero.
why, it's just like you could read what was inside of me.
we have no juliet!
it's great and everything, but what am i going to do with all this?
- or hard wired, right.  first line of perimeter defence'll run from the back of the dock to the front of the house. whatever moves burps or bleep is gonna be picked up to a height of twenty feet. basically impenetrable, i'd say.
why picton?
ok, now that that's over with...what are you gonna make me for breakfast?
you1re leaving, too?
just polite. well, maybe you'd like to try riding again, some time before you go home.
don't worry about it, man.  get the phone.
yeah it is. your name's frank.
the colt's still too small.
looks like business is booming.
we'll forget it right now. finish your drink.
the one with the shotgun.
they'll all be fine.  who better to get the children through jurassic park than a dinosaur expert?
really fucking awesome.
i don't fool around with you.
who the fuck is momo? jesus, these fucking names...
you can't. you're going to be valedictorian.
my stupid back.
tell you what, we'll jump together.
good day.
gimlet.
amen to that.
... we, we love her, dick and me ...
look at me, ray.
you sure?
why did you do this?
-- and what did you suggest?
one has to keep the distance between `them' and `us'
officer starling. welcome back.
how thoughtful of you. and what if i decide not to go?
i was actually trying to see about getting a little advice, you know --
oh, you don't have to worry about that.
go on.
it's the car, right? chicks love the car.
this one has been so hyped. we're tied for most wins with northglen north. this year's winner will determine the winner of the century. the theme is everything. so whatever southglen picks has to be totally unique--
nope.  somebody's thinking about this one.
incidentally, 'joe' what?
no problems on both counts.
i'll second that.
that's a feather in your cap, man. the paper of record.
which number do you want, george?
oh, space!  -- you said the right thing.
...and buried him.
and yet he attacked us. and told the ba'ku we were a threat...
sorry.
you know it's for you.
of course.  but only on monday nights.
all right i got a little surprise for you --
jason. you know exactly what to do. that is your mission now.
yes.
are there many windows?
i don't know, john...i mean, to be brutally honest, i'm not so sure what kind of mental shape joanna's in right now.  y'know she admitted she was seeing a shrink.
hero?
a real gentleman...
sal.  he's the killer.  we're vietnam veterans so killing don't mean anything to us, you understand?
these are my opinions based on my experiences with the few women who were good enough to sleep with me.
beats the hell outta me.
that's why she hates me. that's why she makes me sleep in the basement.
yeah, jimmy?
where do our records go to in the castle?
but, jake, i was just...
yeah?
that's it. that's the end.
to...  to kill them.
those guys bother you?
don't look like there's a right way.
but you didn't do much about it, susie.  you walked out, and there i was...solo...and not too good at that.
justice, yes.  paid, i don't know. they like the idea, but my hands are tied with budget restraints.
they're not interested, jake.
don't give up, parker. not ever.
how quickly?
i don't mean to denigrate your misspent youth, lex, but what does that rock have to do with --
thirty-percent.  no more.  or i call another lawyer.  this is the biggest case of your life.  don't try to negotiate.  thirty percent.  say yes or no.
no, nuh-uh, never in a million years!
please... butterfield... i wasn't there.  ask pimm.
better judgment?! to wait until the actual operation -- when it may be too late?
you don't need to know the details of this mission... you're better off if you don't.
i love to swim, and i don't mind the cold at all. it's invigorating.
i am house-trained.
now i think i have upset you. my english perhaps is coarse.
called? when?
really?  very, very?
certainly. right over there.
well, you've spotted me and so you get the reward.
you didn't transform them, willow, you released them.  that was noth- ing.  now change me.
tom, i jus' don't feel like nothin' a tall. without him i jus' don't wanta live.
there.  you see the guy sitting on the porch?  the old ladies and one guy? you know they'll have a couple more in a car somewhere.
the drums. he taught me to play some.
yeah, as soon as we got back.
i thought i was going faster.
some mistake perhaps that --
i'll take her with me to the university tomorrow.  i can't believe i read the test wrong.  i didn't see anything that looked like she was suicidal.
the shazzammeter!
your husband's?
we have numerous witnesses who can confirm that you were not always carrying your banner...
no . . . it's the way it always is . . . on the brink . . . with good fighting evil.
do what i say.
that's okay, hon. i gotta run.
he still living?
with your father and brother gone, they'll kill us and burn the farm!
get a good picture in your mind.
yes... and no. when you come here, you don't really care about the movie.
you're positive of that, aren't you?
it's important.
sure, snake. no problem.  you gonna kill me?
it has nothin' to do with talkin'.
i'm a doctor, but i think i mentioned that. ob-gyn.
i could probably see my bedroom from here. i can see my house. when you see where you live from a distance it's like a dream, isn't it?
hi, dolores.
what do you think?
this is really awkward...
sir, i... come to beg you to confess all, and swear allegiance to the king, that he might show you mercy.
did we create his mind too? not only can this man speak. he can write. he can reason.
i don't control minds. i free them.
worst time at year for dogs is when they get fungus.
you want to come?
it's a fucking staircase! go over it! go over it!
debbie, don't be naive. men are pigs.
oh shurrup and come on john. they're waiting for you in the studio.
what'd he give to you?
you got guts.  you think if sal and me have cut their throats we're gonna let you out?
only because i got pulled out early.
a friend. we were vacationing. eric wanted to see the island and the dinosaurs, so ben found a guy who would take them parasailing. they never came back.
how is it you can look at that hairhead and see god, when all i see is a lucky asshole from reseda.
ninotchka, or shall i say special envoy yakushova...
i have eyes too, and i tell you no one's there. if you deny that, if you insist that this woman you call your friend is in the garden, then i'm afraid i shall have to punish you. do you understand?
he looks perfectly fine.
i remember what he looks like.  i can't forget.
oh, alvy, come on.
i haven't been invited.
that's right.
salvatore. always holding himself above.
she doesn't approve of girls who smoke.
well, that old lovin' horse paid twenty-two forty.  let's see... two hundred i won from the jockey last night. and today at the track... i got five hundred and forty bucks.  here, you hold it.
only twelve miles away! he could be here day after tomorrow.  find your man, sir! captain beams will give you the message.
personal matters.
forget about me kat.
what theory?
you didn't say that about the food?
it has to be this way for now.  it won't be long.
ya hope i don't keep acting like a whore or i'll turn into one, right?
it's still bleeding a little. here, let me put this on.
i know i can bench more than that!
excuse me, we need to make a call.
oh karl, jesus christ karl, don't do that.
i hate to tell you guys, but only two out of every class make it into jets. which one of you is going with me?
goodbye, darling!
good morning.
it's her.  this is the woman who i've seen.
so is my wife, asshole!!
she's a witch, that one. i tell you what happen yesterday?
just a guard.
i'm crazy about you.  by the way, your pin.
figures.  anybody seen my scope?
not... totally.
good luck, buzz.
there are no coincidences, sam. everything's connected, all along the line. cause and effect. that's the beauty of it. our job is to trace the connections and reveal them.  this whole buttle/tuttle confusion was obviously planned from the inside. bye bye.
a partner with secrets isn't much of a partner.
yeah. hold this. it might be safer.
you okay?
how many tickets can i put you down for?
a what?
now, here's a babe!
madam grusinskaya's car is to be brought.
what was what?
napoleon... small.
he tried to kill him twice before. that's a good place to start don't ya think? leo was on the other side, wasn't he?
uh--that's good. and--uh--you?
oh. it's fine. what's another ten pounds?
keep them alive.
i couldn't do it. not to you.
i can't say that i've paid that much attention to 'em before.
i'm sorry, mister mcmurphy, i count only eight.
-- the fuck are you talking about?
yes. most of the chamdo region is now in chinese hands. there is a report from chamdo which makes quite clear that, unless some settlement can soon be reached, communist troops will soon be marching on lhasa.
maybe this wasn't just a trick. maybe you're in danger of real love, real involve --
size has no meaning.  it matters not.  look at me.  judge me by my size do you?
remember the one where bud lost his cousin when he was s'posed to be watching him?
yes, mr. fielding - you'll pick her up after the show in your motorboat - goodbye - what's that you said?  oh - zowie! i'll give her the message. 
sweetheart, you don't know the half of it.
i believe we share an art instructor
i care about you, a - but i just don't have those kind of feelings for you. i'm sorry. i'm not in love with you.
she want to play?  fine.  i can play.
fair's fair.
not at first, but then i heard the same inflection in a voice at a social gathering and i put two and two together.
listen, darling. i want you to look once more. take as long as you want. look very carefully, and then i want you to tell me that no one's there.
not yet...
and you called your friend, and she's telling you not to go?  when i went to europe my friends told me i was crazy.
h-hey, m-mack.
belong - to you? that sound medieval - something out of an old melodrama...
you look nervous.
get everyone in hell ready. when the blood of terrance and phillip spills, the day is ours!
who?
we could lock down passport control and all ports of authority, but that won't stop ambrose, and beyond him, we don't know who else we're looking for -- all terrorist bank accounts of which we're aware are stable.  no deposits, no withdrawals.  therefore no suspects.
yeah?
i think i was very clear, ted. if everything else falls apart, maybe.
i move for no man.
what exactly is the treatment here going to be then?
yes?
i trust mr. johnson filled you in on the revisions.
well, so far it isn't funny, but wait. he says to the waiter, "waiter! bring me a cup of coffee." so the waiter comes back five minutes later and says, "i'm sorry, sir, we have no coffee."...  wait a minute... wait a minute... i'm all mixed up...  a man comes in a restaurant, he sits down, he calls the waiter and he says, "waiter! get me a cup of coffee without cream," and five minutes later the waiter comes back and says, "i'm sorry, sir, we have no cream, can it be a glass of milk!"
...all right, eve.  if you say so.
yes.  it is.  it is simple, and you know what the hard part is?
i was with valerie, i swear. this is adrian's work. i've got to find him.
and i to make yours, monsieur le marquis.
ohhh!
doctor, you're the one who told me what it was!
i came down here to close a deal for studebaker.
i appreciate you telling me.
...what...?
what do you want, courtney?
they won't.
give it a rest. you were thinking the same thing, just didn't have the guts to take the heat.
no, i'm serious. give us your whole basic philosophy in a nutshell.
so, what's this sarah got that you don't? three tits?
i need a drink.
i stand corrected.  wyatt.  you're an oak.
what, your dick?
shut up! just shut up! i don't need them.
well, we can only guess about that, edna. they *are* against the law.
how would you know that?
what is it?
yes.
yeah, i'd say you're right on the money.
make it on his own? does he know the kind of money involved? i mean the real money. he thinks he's gonna become champ on his own? we're gonna sit by and see some nut come in there and hold one of the most important titles in the world? a nut who don't listen to nobody or respect nobody? is he really crazy? listen, joey, you understand, you tell him. i don't care how great he is or how colorful. he could beat all the sugar ray robinsons and all the janiros he wants to. he ain't gonna get a shot at the title without us. i'm not askin' you to do another thing except get that message into that thick head!
gold. you were going to—
hello there. are you two heading for las vegas?
then i'll be there for you.
of course. of course. then i'll take the ship without your help.
we can't break free!
but that's a wonderful quality, not a bad quality.  have a little patience with her. she's such a good-hearted little thing and tries so hard.
okay lloyd. first, no way does frida have the physical strength to tear a guy to shreds. second, why would she be so obvious and let it be known she was the last one to see these guys? third, she's the one in danger. she's a woman in jeopardy and you're layin' a murder rap on her. fourth, i look in her eyes and know she's no killer.
you can't just run home every time things get tough. first of all, we've got enough dough to --
i guess he's pretty, uh, racially pretty cool--
port-au-prince.
not like this -- no. i haven't faced death, i cheated death. i tricked my way out of death and patted myself on the back for my ingenuity. i know nothing.
i'd pull the trigger and shoot him right between the eyes.
jean... me dear, loyal jean... why do you want to oppose the will of god?  jeanne wanted to go to compiegne -- we let her -- she got caught.  then, on my personal orders, regnault proposed 30,000 crowns for her ransom, and once again the answer was no.  and now you say she tried to escape, and the answer is still no.  jean, open your eyes -- can't you see the hand of god in all this?
my lead bird. he's always on that top perch.
was this girl from starliner towers?
yes.
of course i am.  now give me a kiss and say good night like my good boy.
they stamped it, didnít they?  those damn gideons.
you're not one of those guys from the military, are you? trying to teach whales to retrieve torpedoes, or some dipshit stuff like that?
he taught all this to swann?
i'll whisper some of the main parts of the story to you.  but you'll be surprised how much you understand.  the music conveys the story more powerfully than any words.
thought you hate your old man.
hmm.
but don't you <u>do</u> anything.  you just have a seat, wait for me to get there.
yes. i'll give you that!
oh well... you know me.
don't worry. he's out of town.
what?
--vanished.
i think i gotta go.
what's the matter?
i don't care who you are ...  i just want to get you outta here, safe, right?
i looked up to you, uncle.  my brother always said i was a fool. never trust the british, he said: the deal-makers, the map-makers; never shake hands with them.
hello, charlie -  i didn't know we were speaking.
go catch jimmy, ray. really. he's gettin' away. go ahead, go get him. i'm late.
six months.
never mind -- i'll get it. i have a whole day. i'll be on that train.
what proper grounds?  you can't be in love with me.  you hardly know me.  i'm not in love with you.
no!
lestat! you knew lestat!
call the police.
if you liked notes from underground, you'll love the idiot.
except for the part about my setting up a company in zurich and knowing anyone named sam vollotti and having any relationship whatsoever with the gambino family.
nothing.  it got messed up.
uh huh.
anybody we know?
ok, so who was it, then?
why do you say that?
one thing at a time. i'll see you in twenty minutes. go.
there's something buried there.
he ditched me.  he started running, and i started running, then he lost me in the park.
oh... kinda the same way.
what about everything i said to you this afternoon...
a cold drink? you mean one cold drink? to feast yore starvin' fishy l'il eyes on the picture? a true vision of paradise itself? with two of the angels right there in plain sight a- friskin' round with mah boy?
it's my charter. my party.
you're the one who wanted to drive fast.
so you're going to kill her?  put the gun down claire.
jus' keep doin' y'damage girl, keep these mafuckas off my as--
this one's still with the fire department. one of our best investigators, don rimgale, is working on a very difficult, visible case right now. we think he could use another pair of hands and you're exactly the kind of guy i want representing us: an authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan.
been here long?
everybody's divorced.
i don't know, what? thirty, forty maybe.
she's very pretty.
sixty, maybe seventy families.
well, what d'you know?!
he said that?
you will have to forego the pleasure of hangin' me.
c of e, sir.
how can you avoid a man you've never met?
ask security.  you tell him, price. you've got me shadowed every minute of the day. or haven't you found out yet?
you mean sandro, don't you?  well, i beg of you, please, spare me that. goodbye, dad.
a real live pimp?
never closed my eyes.
you take charge.
i couldn't kill buzz. i need his help. theo helps millie load suitcases into the trunk of her car.
you play--left field.
i thought -- is kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight ——walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. no. not my favorite client. she's going to make an entrance this town will never forget!
i'm not here to negotiate.
awwwww!
i can't...
i was here this afternoon.
what is your location?
stop the damn car.
not me... all my other my patients. i smelled tar and feathers on the way over here.
i gotta do this, stephen. i gotta know.
this is where baxter and hawley brung us.
i didn't think so.
nothin'  i'll be okay, pop.
yes, sir!--i will, sir--certainly, sir!
what's the surprise?
what do you mean?
what a pity, all that fire and music being turned off...
listen to this one...the commander says to the sergeant: 'you remember that windmill that used to be there?' 'yes, sir, i remember the mill's gone but the wind's still there!'  you remember the story of the soldier and the princess? 
yes.  is he there?
jeanne -- be careful -- you're not helping yourself by refusing to submit to our judgment...
yes?
"myers", huh? you have a first name??
uh, hi.
you know, i've got to do some shopping afterwards. do you want to go?
no.
let's...hold up for a bit.  it may not happen.  our secret, okay?
thanks, tom.  thanks.
yes he is.
jason? he's on this ship?!
they're true!  everything i said! witholding that veto was treason!
what if it's true?  "great at friendship bad at intimacy." i mean, come on.  it's the theme of my bachelor film --
well, to be honest, the idea of getting old with darryl was kinda startin' to get to me.
i'm just trying to determine if mr. zavitz was involved in something more than a simple bus accident.
it will numb my wits, and i must have them all. if i'm senseless, or if i wail, then longshanks will have broken me.
coming.
no ball, kid.
[si.]
a what?
captain clayton...captain!
describe him.
... both.  did i just see a man in a red suit and goggles?
i know what you want but it can't be done!
i saved your life. you owe me. so either you let me be your partner or i'm going after harvey on my own.
hey!
cecile, we just made out in the middle of central park. you can trust me.
oh, and no ship that's not crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out could possibly have black sails and therefore couldn't possibly be any ship other than the black pearl.  is that what you're saying?
my name is louis peluso.
the nlf has condemned you to death.
oh christ. doc...
fuck you, kid.
oh, my darling.  i'm sorry, too.  i won't do that again -- whatever you do.  i won't cause you any more embarrassment, i promise.
yeah.
well, if my intentions are what you think they are -- if i do wish to step into your shoes, what then?  i have no other intentions than you had yourself.  lady cosgrove's wealth may be great, but am i not of a generous nature enough to use it worthily?  her rank is lofty, but not so lofty as my ambition.  i will be sworn to muster just as much regard for my lady cosgrove as you ever showed her; and if i win her, and wear her when you are dead and gone, corbleu, knight, do you think that it will be the fear of your ghost will deter me?
this should do it.
ever durned one.
captain.  i'd like to volunteer for duty with the new detective.
don't need water.  we didn't have no pool in the projects...so none of us swim.
two bits.
parents? nobody cares a damn, what's the use of them!
the owl told him about leo. that's incredible. i guess we just broke the back of this investigation, didn't we? evidence doesn't get any harder than that -- not for my money. is there anyway we can seduce this owl into federal court?
then don't waste time talking to me.
no, no.
i'll say.
now don't start this.
i had to get back to the desert. i made a promise.  the rest meant nothing to me.
but! i'm a married woman!
you're meddling with powers you cannot possibly comprehend.
robbed?
for the mini-bike fund.
rawhide, go find out how professor hikita's coming with that formula. mrs. johnson, take casper and scooter, gas up the jet car.
found one of the missing victims from that boat deal.
some kind of emergency back at the sheriff's station. four deputies shot... some kind of explosion... i don't know what's going on, but they're panicking back there.
he won't even know who it was.
he wants to know if you ever watch the cookie monster. he says the cookie monster is not to be trusted -- a trickster.
thanks, much. good luck with the genital tucking.
nothing we can't repair -- so long as the electrical adapts.
at what intervals does he whistle?
now, swana...
kin you spare a moment for me jabez?
i have only one concern...
shh . . . !  i'll wait for you upstairs.
where are we going?
all right.
thanks, handyman.
you can't keep being his father...
there has to be.
yeah, he hated me from day when i was born.  put it out.  can you put the cigarette out?
how long till the drug wears off ?
i am -- i'm captain b.l. willard. this is chief warrant officer phillips -- it's his boat. we were shot up bad downriver and need repairs and food -- we can pay you in gold.
don't play simple with me, jake. you're a betting man. you want me to spell it out for you? i'll kill grace if you cut me in on the money.
well, what's nice about her? tell us!
well, brain-dead anyway.  coma patient. it's really not all that important.
what is this about?
i wish i could say the same for myself. i was up thinking about you all night.
i just...
i assure you they do.  so... answer me... when was the last time you heard this voice?
i know... my girlfriends all dumped me after i put on the mask. they thought i'd lost it.
alright, but i ain't drinking. and you're gonna have to look after me.
-- water! --
well, they fucked it up.
what?
the same as the firs two. definitely a serial.
it really is.  did you find anything?
i was doing the lambada with her and the guy freaks, he breaks my arm, tries to kill me. i swear man, the guy thought i was a pi–ata. if nobody else hadn't a been there, he wouldn't have stopped. he woulda killed me. fuckin' guy man, just snapped. how do you like your burger?
...that...he <u>sees</u> that...
yeah, the fucking lawyer.
i knew it.
what i need are some answers. 
put it down!
your eyes told me.
shaddup bitch.
please don't shout.
i've got a slip movement to install on my next shift.  i'll never make it the way i am now.
i'm not worth risking your life for.
a wonderful choice of places to dock a boat, mr. robertson.
i can't stay on this planet.
everybody love linda.
if you want to sell your service, i'm not willing to be the price... i loved him. you loved him. what good have we done him. look at yourself, they have names for faces like that.
i knew you would, pal.  a bird in a gilded cage, eh?
aw, c'mon.
four hundred bucks.
recommend defensive posture, captain: screens and shields.
because i don't like you.
nope - afraid i'm all out of tricks tonight.
dick, what's with those guys out there in the gutter? 
i've got a right to carry a gun if i want to.
i want more life, fucker.
of course she knew! for one thing, addison told her how superbly eve had read the part-!  karen, let me tell you about eve. she's got everything - a born actress. sensitive, understanding, young, exciting, vibrant-
it is very convenient to place all the blame on a dead man.
yeah. the way i see it. my outlook on the this situation is.  it's like getting fame, you know what i'm saying. it's like, if you died tomorrow, and fifty years from now all the virgins you fucked are gonna remember you because you were their first.
i've filed a report with father frank.
so he's going. uh... are there any other tickets charged to the same account?
well if i don't who will?
objection.
okay, okay, we have a nine percent chance of getting back together. does that clarify the situation?
i'm okay. i just don't want to lis- ten.
we're like his handlers. he can't function without us.
nicky? oh my god. stay right there.
what's that?
really?
i've been trailing the cashier like you told me. you're right about that guy, chief. there's something screwy somewhere.
i'll call you.
oh, perfect!  he reminds me of ichabod crane.  his adam's apple keeps jumping up and down whenever he gets excited. hannah  listen.  he's a lot better than your ex-husband.  he's got a good job.  would you light those, please? he's-he's-he's not a dope addict or anything.
well, this measures the amount of thermal imbalance within a room down to the tiniest molecular disturbances.
-- you were with her. you were in the cab, weren't you?
for a little while.
did you say 'kill' my sister?
17.
you hang out with me because nobody else can stand to be around you.
i'd a found you, ma.
yeah, it was edited for tv. all the good stuff was cut out and i started thinking about us and how two years ago, we started off kinda hot and heavy, a nice solid "r" rating on our way to an nc17. and how things have changed and, lately, we're just sot of... edited for television.
the professor asked me for it -- i thought it was for something scientific!
non-terrestrial intelligence.  ntis.  yeah, i like that better then ufos.  although that works too... underwater flying objects.
yes!  and he was such a dork!  and everyone laughed at me, but i didn't care?  because it was so funny!
it's like having an eleventh finger removed.  it hurts like hell, but you never really needed the damn thing in the first place.
what do i get for it?
that's the understatement of the year.
i don't like to lose, either.
you're right.
no, take it.
you've never been to a dance, have you?
so it would seem.
okay... thank you.
yeah.
call jane for me.  she's at the little thai place.
i don't think so.
don't do anything silly.
how about hand-to-hand combat?
always.
four hundred?
isn't that bad for it?
more or less.  son, i'm sorry. they got us.
no.  i guess.
i'm going to take it.
every day in every way.
yes. she has read your books and has a profound admiration for you, as have we all.
what are you doing?
if you'd seen the blood on his head--and some body had to carry him out to sea--
and she used her tits and that cute little ass to get him, didn't she?
eric...
okay, major, honey.  i'm going to have a couple shots scotch and go to bed. i'd normally ask you to join me but obviously you're a female version of the routine regular army clown. and that turns me off, so just leave my outfit alone and we'll get along fine.  see you around the campus.
but this is class kid, all the way. what a way to go.
movin' in's mighty thirsty work. i usually sit out on my porch of an evening and pour a couple of beers over m'dinner. come on over and join me, if you want.
so you could talk to these scientists and they do what?  send you to the future?
yeah.
do you follow or should i speak slower?
flanking riders?
get your things.
pots and pans.
i don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?
too fine, badalato. the bad news is, you're gonna live.
i'll buy you a new one.  i found her.
so what's that mean?  that you're disappointed by what you found or you're sorry you robbed all those banks?
mom, i heard someone downstairs!
stella!
he didn't recognize me. back off, willya? he didn't recognize me.
you don't know me, do you?
i'd rather mr. kane withdrew without having to get the story published. not that i care about him.  but i'd be better off that way -  - and so would you, mrs. kane.
i work graveyard, swing and day all by my lonesome.
i used my body on the guards.  it gave me control. i got to a gun and i took my chance.  i’ve never told anyone that.
eight.
you -- you're too fast.
does the case lock?
she wasn't a nun?
great.  classic timing.  why don't you ask her just to leave a date for the divorce?  i'll check my diary later.
the hutu-tutsi thing. the bbc faxed to say they would be here on the sixth for the peace accords. and the u.n. wants the banquet room for that day, a reception to broadcast the signing ceremony. can you organize monitors and check the satellite dish?
oh, of course.
i don't know. i was just curious.
"what are you thinking?"...that was it. the hours are hell, but the money's starting to tumble in. i know this guy who's got an iron- clad way to make money, i can't lose and i can't get hurt.
you're just realizing this now?
i don't trust you. no way! i pick who goes! and i'm holding you responsible.
what?
i have no defense.  so far as i know -- it is true.
tell me one?
i'm sorry alma, i didn't mean to sound so ...
i like 'em. if you don't you can f --
how's our friend?  what is he, "dead?"
here, have this can of campbell's tomato soup.
what do you expect?  you're dead.
am i hallucinating here? just what in the hell do you think you're doing?
let's forget the future... let's stop being sentimental... let's start that omelet.
frances, we gotta do it this way. just remember tomorrow, remember what i told you. what're you gonna tell 'em?
well look. i have no intention of taking her out.
i'll say.
you're going to pay a terrible price. the power of shadow is tricky. use it too much and it takes over.
who gives a fuck?! i was just fucking with him!
sure is.  so why call me?
we are?
the chairs.
addison, will you please say what you have to say plainly and distinctly - and then get out so i can take my nap!
i'm sorry, john.
well, i'd say that makes him a lia- fuckin-bility.
you treat me like i was.
we want some grass.
he didn't make a pass at me! i told you a million times!
why not?
don't they believe in signs here?
'thief in the night?'
and you already know herr heinze of the third reich.
oh.
goodbye, dante.
bembry saved my life. the honorable elijah muhammad saved my life.
sang.
yeah, very funny.
milo? shrot suspects somebody broke into #21. i was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts.
that's too bad.
just give me the keys.
i haven't felt like talking to him since that thing came out.
i accept it. what are the causes of suffering?
yes!
but you -- died --
no.
i wasn't hitting on your girl!
you turned leo over on his face. but the coyotes must've turned him back over, man, cuz his spirit is out. it's out, and it knows.
hey, marty, come over here a minute.
didn't even have to ask.
hello.
did you have a nice flight?  are they taking good care of you?
look at you. you're helping run things now. you're a gangster. i bet that snuck up on you. you woke up one day and you were a criminal.
it could mean that, yes.
at the party.
it's go time, billy-b.
<u>will you please be quiet</u>!  commander chekov, this is completely irregular. who gave the order you are quoting? who gave the order?
how goes it, darlin'?
am i s'posed to be grateful?
i'm not doing cocaine.
that's what i'm talking about.
did you buy the horse, papa?
it's his life insurance money, you know.
he's alive!
berries.
...ya gave dipper my locker.
why cancoon?
i mean, how can you go through life without never having made a prank call?
...are you alright, sir...?
wait 'til you get into trouble, just wait.
coming to see me.  are you trying to. . humiliate me?
i don't care.
i don’t know.
that's too bad.
it’s over, cotton.
there's schools in california.
he's the best.
anybody here wanna double their bet?
it's a test.  if i asked her to come and she came, it wouldn't tell me anything. if i tell her not to come, and she comes...then i know she loves me.
paul said he'd call the school.  and your father thinks he's convinced the guard not to press charges as long as you get help.
oh my god.
if such there breathe, i'm sure you could <u>unearth</u> him...  your reputation does you honor. 
i got through to greer, his partner in the detective business.  greer won't give out.
what did you say your name was?
your father?
you're jo- whatta yuh kid- what did you do, grow up in a norman rockwell painting?
james, you don't know what you are talking about. quit trying to hold on so tight. i'm gone... long gone like a turkey through the corn.
i'm endangering the mission. i shouldn't have come.
alive... i'm alive...
what the fuck possessed you?
oh that explains everything.
sra-i'm-sick! sra-i'm sick!
look who knows so much. well, it just so happens that your friend here is only mostly dead. there's a big difference between mostly dead and all dead. please open his mouth.
john, sir.
the past fifteen minutes.  it seems to be a pattern, doesn't it? they strike and disappear, and then they start massing again.
whatever you say, lady.  it's all in a day's work for me.
i guess it's getting serious.
i have to.
and?
no problem, mr. ullman.  i was just getting to the ice cream.
there's more.
- we made a fire.
soon, but first i must bless this house.
leia!
one napkin, coming up.  i wish we had some champagne to wrap it around.
okay, real good, then.
p.a. what the hell is that?
you... don't have to... leave.
you didn't have to do this.
i think you're fucking crazy!
we won! we won!
they know he got hit in the face.
where?
uh-oh.
i see -- it's just the erlanger claim then.
i think it looks good.
it's just fed.  it won't attack unless it's threatened.  don't move.
i bring her flowers too.
get the gun.
here and there. around.
plumbing. everything modern. i'm going to run pipes all through the village—
what do you think is the most humiliating way to die?
i made it up.  it's horseshit!
that... huh... they just shoot you with drugs.
yes, she is.
i think maybe you been on this boat a little too long, with all that supernatural mumbo jumbo. there's nothing supernatural about greed. and that's what it comes down to, pure and simple.
the jewish worker's salary, you pay it directly to the ss, not to the worker. he gets nothing.
no.
watch clark.
yes... i...
wait. i want to listen.
trust me, you're not missing anything.
i've never seen him before in my life. i'm just trying to help you out.
good.  she's a good girl.  aren't you? yeah, she's a lovely girl.  and you know the queen's riding tomorrow?
jack wells.  a museum sent you?
you've lost everything?
for a consideration.
sssshh. come here.
maybe it's a game.  maybe he's trying to send us a message.
in my house, you watch that lip...
you certainly have not, 655321. you've been very helpful, and you've shown a genuine desire to reform.
psychologist, therapist, whatever.
you mean soap?
i apologize for canceling shore leave, but look, we have a dangerous situation out on nimbus iii.
who? elizabeth?
when you start with that attitude... it's like i don't know who you are.
bugger off, you bloody sod.
well, same ol' same ol'.
nice girl, mary.
me neither. how 'bout you carrie?
thanks.
maybe i'm gettin' like mose harper -- my bones is cold tonight...
gotta hex from a voodoo?
you know, i jus' can't remember when i felt so good before!
i don't know. tastes okay to me.  hey, they got a reserve pinot.
huh?
i'll see to it that he serves under me.
like a bug.
objection.
you're breaking my heart.
nope. i think the man is a liar.
oh my g-d.
why don't ya then.
so if there are alternatives that make sense -- and i'm not saying there are -- we need 'em. need 'em fast.
it's not something i wanted either.
so you do know her.
i'm sorry, pal, but i had a meeting and--
come over to my house whenever you want. i'll tell my mom.
if you were set up, i want to find out who did it.
i don't need a tuxedo.
who'll i aim at?
you can do anything you want if you set your mind to it.
what are you getting at?
it's better you see for yourself --
oh come on. for her first time?
so what? it's nothing to be ashamed of. you have nothing to be ashamed of, okay?
i've got to see.
my mom wanted me to have this?
you did.
sounds like it!  distress call, from a small freighter, between ellesmere island and greenland. one mayday, then...nothing.
i, that what all that nonsense was about this morning? you're worried about my business?
but 'tis no wit to go.
that's ordell's.
yeah. i've got it here in this bag. i thought i should bring it to you.
well, i hope you've changed.
she knows who we are.
who are we to decide the next course of evolution for these people?
thank you.

one night stand?
hah?
i could have lied i suppose, but i want this marriage to be legal. i just want you to know, i'm trying to start a new life here. i'm depending on your...
all right... i'll pack my stuff tonight.
yeah.
don't you ever heat that stuff up.
i'm going to squeeze you, corleone, because i don't like you; i don't like the kind of man you are.  i despise your masquerade, and the dishonest way you pose yourself and your fucking family.
please, veronica. last thing i need is a lecture at this point.
thank you. no.
well, without a cure for the virus, we're nothing more than digestives anyway.
trouble. why?
you don't got half what tehronne got.
wasn't i humiliated? by all of you? didn't you lead me around on a leash?
working on it now, sir.
you watch your back hammer. hanukkah might just be his first move. for all we know kwanzaa could be next. there's a lot of brothers counting on you. if you fail...
i went myself to oversee the operation. didn't help much.
billy bob's dead. -- we were wrong -- he didn't do anything. i-it's the scarecrow --
could be anything... men in isolation... some beef that snowballed... got out of hand...
no, you don't understand.
yeah.  but i got my bike.
what are you doing? what are thev doino? ~7c int. sarris' ship	h37c
why do people think i'm you?
at least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on you...tell me a little about her.  she got great tits?
nothing.
uhh - martini?
captain, i didn't come out here to sit on your bridge, i need to be on that ship...
oh, it's a similar room. but the hotel is in washington d.c. you're not going to get a fair trial down here, in front of a jury of jesse james sympathizers.
i'm sorry, sir, i apologize.  but if you weren't a captain, or if i were a major, what would you say?
absolutely nothing.  how is he?
i supposed you'd like a leg. how about two?
and mulwray isn't?
you goin to shoot yourself? 
they took care of that, thank you, henry. 
not with what they pay me...
she's having a baby. twins.
at least jimmy and mickey want to help. i talk to mickey every day. that's more than i can say for the rest.
you're an artist. i'm a craftsman.
where?
i sort of invited him along to bend an elbow. you don't mind, do you?
we were forced to use restrains if that's what you're referring to.
do you expect me to believe...?
lizard dna and human dna on the same strand?  impossible.  the sample must be contaminated.
no, we'll find something around here.
here we are, mag wheels...  hey jack, are you sure you’re okay?
no i don't.  she worries about you.
what'll i tell the kids?
all right.  i'll second that.
yes.
let me see now--don't tell me--  you're dumber than me and i'm dumber than you. i don't get it.
<i>                      jack said we should work together.</i>
admiral, if we were to assume these. whales are ours to do with as we please, we would be as guilty as those who caused their extinction.
apparently.
you okay?
hi.
not enough, i guess.
stop it!
i know you lost all his work. maybe i could come down here and --
who?
stop it. i'm...
no, you're absolutely r...
how often does he get like that?
yes... yes.  i think i will...
i had a feeling you would.
everybody has a story, skip.
cole, did you or did you not record that message?
where?
they've got you bugged, and they'll be busting down the door in about three minutes unless you do exactly what i say.
it's amazing.
thank you.
well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port.  alotta meant nothing to me.
look, we don't care if you bring in the state milita, the volunteer fire department, the l.a. thunderbirds, the ghost of steve mcqueen, and the twelve roman gladiators, so long as we get credit for the bust.
where?
well they can fucking un-post it!
well we got some workin' money anyway.
then it was over the water department.
if sheep don't count.
no, i'm serious.  you know what kurt potter is?  he's the kind of guy who never would have taken this case in the first place. he's the kind of guy who would have sold these plaintiffs down the river when pg&e offered 20 million.  he doesn't work like us, ed.  there's no little voice in his head telling him to do the right thing.
you didn't do your homework?
i thought ten years.
really.
but you're not married.
yeah. good food. you've got quite a wine collection. very impressive.
rye.
none of us like it!
don't make me tell you, jason.
you can't trust you with anything, norm, if you've lost him, i'll cripple you.
- i'll be sure to acknowledge 007's 'assistance' in my report to the prime minister. but this is, still, a naval operation.
you've got it, master.
now he'll be up all night...
what i do isn't about revenge.
shit!
oh?
i don't know, sir.
oh --
i have a good crew.
no!! we're going all the way!  you got that, dyson?
all right.  you won't know what to look for at first, scottie. even i, who know her so well, cannot tell, sometimes, when the change has begun. she looks so lovely and normal...
well, i am going to go after lunch.
i don't think so.  it could have been.
he was upset. he thought people were following him.
leavin', boy?
no, you can't have any more chairs! there's only one left in here now, and i need that to sit on!  oh ... er, sorry. who are you?
you can't leave, george.
that's too bad.
the same thing that always happens! you blew it! and this time you broke your son's heart instead of mine!  he was so proud, looking forward to going to a movie with his father... and you let him down!  like you let everybody down, always!  what did you do, take a mudbath?
mine?
c'mon.
sir...?
shh.
are we done now? you've got nothing on me. so if you ain't booking me, i'm walking.
oh, so do i. they're such fun, aren't they? it's all change. all revolving. burials and births. the end to the beginning and the beginning to the end -  - the great circle of life. my, this old thing handles well. ever drive a hearse, harold?
one thing at a time, laz.
do you know the way?
when i was a little girl, on cold nights like this, i used to crawl into bed with my sister.  we'd cuddle up under the covers, and pretend we were lost in a dark cave, and were trying to find out way out.
calm down... look at this, look at him...!
i always felt if a -- boy i liked ever found out -- he'd run. he'd think i was unclean.
even her.
just a car.
what you got, peters?
quit crying.  i think we've got a case if we can make it through the cavalcade of bimbos, here...
--the canuck letter--was that a white house operation--
i do. goodbye. 
you'll see.
jeanne -- if we were to ask forgiveness all the time, we'd spend our whole life in church.
what do ya mean?
you're in the ministry of defense. it's 1997. you've been cryogenically frozen for thirty years.
fine. 
rocco, this is the real deal. we must kill without hesitation, without guilt or remorse. evil man, dead man.
why?
is the job done?
what's the matter?
he's got a gun. he's got a gun.
if i don't see you later -- go to my house and find my notebooks -- and destroy them.  all my manuscripts -- just burn them. please.
did i?  i've been waiting for that for years.
oh, shut up, rose, eat your cornflakes!
you amaze me.
thank you, jane.
and they asked me if we'd like to ... you know... put him up for a while.
life.
you've been working out.
well, forgive me for screwing up your plans!
it's...dead.
please.
grace.  get mr. white a manual typewriter.  it's not a lie, it's a gift for fiction. and somebody find me my lucky pillow.
more of a game, really.
i'm back on the job for the jdl. you hear about that crazy white boy who took over as santa?
trying to break our contract again, mr. stone?
what the fuck are you doing here?
the director of our opera. count orsini-rosenberg.
i wasn't too old when i started the course. i was too old when it finished.
and there's no chance you had this experience simply because some part of you needed to have it?
i'm not sure.
so, what, you liked it because it was shiny?
my last wife was an acrobatic dancer - you know, sort of a contortionist - she could smoke a cigarette while holding it between her toes - zowie! - but mama broke it up.
yes, i do -- very much.
a friend from school.
excuse me? what's your name, son?
then it's going to happen.  the world's going to end.  -- and you've always known.
i think she's about to foal.
i'm sorry.  do you live here?
you look tired.
oh, i hate the other kind.
it's never too soon! girls decide how far to let you go in the first five minutes.
what theater was i at?
 where are my feelings... i feel for no one...
that's terrible news...
our mother can see through bags.
we're way past inappropriate.
excuse me.
sure, sure, we'd all be millionaires. there's no point in looking back. at the time, stilson thought dumping our position would panic the market, further depress the stock -- then we'd buy it all back, and more of course, once it got cheap --
naturally. it would be rather awkward to have three men in one bunk.
we were?
yeah. why, you know him?
say what you gotta say, but i ain't gonna hear you speak his name to me. not never. you hear?
...and your general?
you know dr. maximus, our commissioner for animal affairs?
i said no!
down to the incinerator.
toasty.  were there ever any, like, famous vampires?
what you do?
i'm not your boy, jake.  i don't like you, and i don't like what you are.  i got no choice but to do business with you.  this is just a nasty little marriage of convenience.
who are you talking to?
you have too many dogs.
elliot what?
you're wrong.
you look very grown up.  what are you doing?  you meeting your mom for dinner?
no. but things ain't always like they seem, arletta. you know that. a man's gotta go his own way.
doing what?
good.
what was that?
i left three messages already.
it's not the plaque. the winner can get assigned here as instructor. he gets to fight every day.
you're conning me, sweetheart. i ain't responsible for no baby.
david, i'm sorry i upset you yesterday, but you must understand what is going on.
roper...
josh!
thomas. he told me it was a very nice place.
i don't want to hear about your fucking dreams!
good.  let's get dry.
it was really nice meeting you, jeff. if you're ever in l.a., you should come by the offices. i talked to pony earlier. he said he had a really nice time and he's really looking forward to reading some of your songs.
no?  then maybe you'll understand, mrs. dickson. oh, gee, he's crazy about you. nobody knows it better than you. if he ever finds out, it'll kill him.
sounds like they didn't want anything that wasn't electric?
sure.
that's her?  bianca's sister?
do what?
they are in tune.  but not with each other.
i happen to know so.
she say she in great pain.
... we wouldn't have had our little accident.
i don't have to.  i don't rob banks.
all right, mister ambassador!  but you must treat general "buck" schmuck with the respect due him.
just askin'
i don't know... i just feel scared.
i think i just broke my hand.
then let's get started. the sooner i get to sonora, the better i'll like it.
where?
there's no lights back there.
henry told cyrus he'd kill him if he ever showed his face around our house again. when henry makes a threat like that, people tend to take him seriously.
what can you do?
but there are those who have power over him. i think i'll take this up with the emperor.
is that him? is that him?
the ledge, i know it well, or should i say <u>we</u> know it well.
what'd ya see?
why did you do that, brother? i've never done wrong to you.
it isn't the owner, myra, it's my wife. she knows what's going on. this time, i gotta have the money.
we will both have the salad ticino.
don't belong to you! it's for the little important man, here!
when they're born its like vietnam. it's terrifying.
bummer, huh?  and friday is suppose to be a kick-ass day.
perfect, wonderful, good as i ever felt! except for a big old scar on my stummick, i wouldn't even know i been in the hospital.
it's one of a kind.
well get someone down there!
two hundred years old.
it surrounds you and radiates from you.  a jedi can feel it flowing from him...  ... from here!
c'mon, we can always sneak a big mac. and a cherry turnover. your favorite. what do you say?
i will call the police right now if i don't start getting some answers.
you've been talking to her on the phone for weeks!
why not?
i pay you a good deal of money to be my eyes and ears in hollywood, do i not? if you cannot provide this simple service you are of no use to me.
your face smells like a foot.
it was just a thought.
sure. and i appreciate that. and i want to help you, agent kujan. i like cops. i would have liked to have been a fed myself but my c.p. was -
you were in the room. it was your purview. it was your job to make sure bissel wasn't fucking us over and you didn't do it. you've got the most important job in the world right now. you're the smartest guy the president has.  besides me.
scagnetti? oh shit, i hear he's a motherfucker.
and don't ever get down on your knees again, understand?
remember 1949? last two games of the season. against the yankees. the sox lost on saturday. then they lost on sunday. first i cried for twenty-four hours. then i had fist- fights the rest of the week.
not sitting on our butts in here, that's for sure.
you go first! there's no time!
he grins wolfishly.
cover your mouth.
what was that?
me too. i'm almost there.
that's okay.  i love you anyway.
she jumped.  she'd been depressed.
come on, marion. let's face the truth. nobody's going to publish it.
who do you work for?
all right.  i'm satisfied with the evidence we have right now. i feel vindicated.  john hammond will too.  do you have enough to publish?
but everything's ok?
i never had my house pushed over before. i never had my fambly stuck out on the road. i never had to lose... ever'thing i had in life.
so would i. come on in.
that's why you get the big bucks, captain.
jack! it's jani.
the bicentennial heavyweight championship of the world is gonna be held in the only place it can be held -- philadelphia! -- the nation's cradle -- january first -- the first major event of our two hundredth year.
tyrell, you are an unstoppable force of nature.

i'd like to get paid before that eventually.  i don't plan to stick around for the fireworks.
nick... nick!!! it's the only chance we've got!
what about this?
no.

you really suck, you know that?
<u>then explain it to me</u>. i got enough darkness, don't i?
i couldn't do it at work cause of security or at home for -- obvious reasons.

twelve. cross side.
i should've pegged you guys for bowling dicks from day one.
'u.s.s indianapolis.' 1944.
well, thanks, that's great.
then wouldn't we also know if he's here?
that's beside the point.
you know paul, i've been thinking, maybe this is as good a time as any to have a little talk, you know, about -- well --
no, no!
rug-peers did not do this.  i mean look at it.  young trophy wife. marries a guy for money but figures he isn't giving her enough.  she owes money all over town--
i don't want blood on them.
starting tonight?
excuse me.  i got a bullet in my leg.
ask them.
the point?
okay. let's get serious. of course i know the cult of good is not good. ever since i saw what they did in atlanta, it has been my mission to expose them. i've followed them to oasisburg and soon will have enough hard evidence to bring them to real justice. that computer disc could be the final piece to the puzzle. this isn't just a story, selina--another damn pulitzer--this is my life.
some committee's got it.
there's no real proof that tobacco  --
... no, no, no...
what is it?  a tribe?  an island?
why the interest?
i took a cab.
get out of there – take these back to the office and make up some 'beach closed' signs, and let polly do the printing.
quite a few.
mr rothstein...  i'm pat webb.
i can't afford to make exceptions. once word leaks out that a pirate has gone soft, people begin to disobey you, and then it's nothing but work, work, work, all the time.
i don't like what he does.
amateurs 2
he's over at st. james. they had to put two pins in his arm.
it happens that i'm the law.
you wanna get us busted? if max found out you were turning tricks --
no, not words.
mister finch -- are you trying to seduce me?
nothing.
you didn't visit him in prison.
i'm shocked.  with a child bearing body like yours...  ... why a man would have to be out of his mind!
no. no thank you.
yes.
why would you ask now?  you never asked before!
listen cat, i'll have you know that i hate the taste of watermelon and am a terrible basketball player.
aunt may, what happened?
you never asked me, and every time i brought it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.
oh, i don't mind.
i know.
if i ask him to tell me, will you let him answer?
really, my dear--i don't feel like a thing.
oh, don't be ridiculous.
-- to be put in that kind of position...
howdy, miss gulch.
i'm ye oldest boy name karl.
run anti-virus. give me a systems display!
asshole probably got lost.
it's a real good chocolate cake. duncan hines' devil's food. real good.
i didn't do anything.

he also conducted for hitler, didn't he?
when i first met vaughan, he was a specialist in international computerized traffic systems. i don't know what he is now.
thanks, but i'll take the bus. i do it all the time.
"in the absence of light, darkness prevails." for there are things that go bump in the night, agent myers.  we are the ones who bump back.
okay...thanks.
cut it out stupid.  it's me.
i doubt it.
oh god, patrick. why price? price?
we're liable to win if we keep this up. for somebody like you, you sure run fast.
that's a-no good.  you gotta insult somebody from another country.  look --  i come from one country.  you come from another country.  i say something you don't like.  you say something i don't like - and i'm insulted.
yeah?
no... i don't. why?
i thought you wanted an answer. and that's the only one i have.
no, sir.
roger, roger. what's our vector, victor?
well, what do you really think, though?
hey - i love gloves-  i look really great in gloves.
okay.  we'll deduct it from my salary.
guess that makes you pretty special.
absolutely.
sure.
what baby?
impossible.  once the reaction starts, it'll spread to all the turbinium in the planet.  mars will go into global meltdown.--that's why the aliens never turned it on.
i'm dyin'. i'm dyin'.
come on, come on! we gotta keep moving!
no. what about your camera girl? did she come?
dancing?
i just want to know where he is.
i beg your pardon, sir?
see something you like, my man?
i uh, by and by i come--but if thou mean'st not well, i do beseech thee--
i bet you do.
i thought it was appropiate.
and our troops here?
serial killer is not really accurate, ma'am. the killer has yet to strike twice.
and i expect you to.  let's talk like two medical men 
outta my way!  here i come, here i come --
he's a sense/net chairman. why would he launch an a.i.?
now, why don't you get around to saying what you want.
what's in florida?
"my parents are right upstairs! they think you've left..."
oh, we just wonder if you can be very objective about this case.
i was just tryin' to...to...
are you... are you gonna... kill little bill?
i think.  my hair.  where's hector?!  where is he?
yes.  now, will you let me go to chicago?
what a shame.
yeah, dad.  what the hell is going on?
the net would have to be secured by the intake passage.
'course he's coming.
wife, huh? i'd love to meet her, craig.
you don't usually ask.
that'll be all today, mr. carter. you've been most understanding. good day, mr. carter!
i don't know, i'm just havin' some trouble seeing you two together.
an o-filler. you fill in all the spaces in the o's, with your pencil.  i was watching you.
not in a thousand years.
well, what i wanna do is go back to work. but i got this scagnetti prick deep up my ass. he won't let me leave the halfway house till i get some piece of shit job. my plans have always been to be part of the team again.
what the hell was it doing in the fire?
that would be good. but i mean more like. i don't know. like when i was having sex with her, i kept thinking how much i would like to put it in her ass. just to see what would happen.
merry christmas.
it's hopeless -- i don't even know what we're looking for.
deal. and if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, shoot him.
well, nothin'.
when?
this colony needs another tunnel like a hole in the ground.  why are we even digging this thing?
it's not what you think, jake.
i don't plan on dying.
oh, no do not say that. you have been so kind to me. i was afraid to say too much. people always want me to be quiet. you wanted me to speak, but i was afraid. forgive me.
professor -- there are some doors that shouldn't be opened, marty said softly, without turning around.
in the end, after you've killed and captured every freak out there -- there's still one left: you.
the garden.  take him there.  move, people.  let's do this!
oh, how are you, baxter.  they keeping you busy these days?
the important thing is, the police won't believe you.

you're married.
you started out to be a successful newspaper woman, didn't you?
you never disappointed me.
save your money, stud muffin. the lady at the end of the bar sends her love.
you're right. let's never stop...
and if you hadn't been pretty darned interested in that script, he wouldn't have tried to get me on the phone ten times.

...i have never met a man who was so well beloved.
why is that?

oh, i don't know... i think that once i dye my hair blonde, buy a string bikini and cultivate that tan... i could be veggin' out with the best of 'em...  like fer shurr!
yeah, mack?
how long will these take?
the stewardess let me keep my headphones.
i do.
well, i play the tuba.
suzanne? very pretty. she was a semi- professional model. but a policeman's wife she wasn't. so one day, she just packed it and left. and his whole life went straight down the nearest toilet.
well, you didn't have to go and hit me, did you?  is my nose bleeding?
i stand for something. and i'm trying to communicate something.
we have volunteered to rendezvous with the klingon ship that's bringing chancellor gorkon here, and escort him safely through federation space.

so what are you guys doing this summer?
bam bam.
all the gory details.
by killing them?
why are you saying that? [beat] we don't have long, do we?
my brother says the guy's a thirty- five year old virgin, so maybe he won't know how women usually feel. plus he's got bad eyesight, almost legally blind, which is helpful in this situation. plus he's got an extremely small penis, of which he is "mortifyingly ashamed", so chances are he'll be so grateful for any non- judgmental attention, that he'll be yours forever.
because -- i am.
well, you should be!  thanks to you, my heart is in my neck!
subtlety?
men, huh?
yeah, but don't pick me up. my father may think it's strange. i'll walk over to your house. i'll be there at eight o'clock.
il signor ripley ha una fidanzata, il signor dickie ha una fidanzata e probabilmente il signor freddie miles ha molte fidanzate.
and that dump you live in! those clown pictures on the walls!
let's boogie.
well, i'm sure with the proper guidance he'll be fine.
seventy-five.
i see.  so, amazing spider-man-- i'll assume that's not your given name--
i gave them me.  said some nice things about me, rudy. i appreciate it. but don't worry. i do love her. and she loves me. you had that right all along.
come on, artoo.  we'll need your scanners.
could you just check, because the young man who works in my building--
you also cut your hair short like a man, and in the bible it clearly states that it is an abomination for a woman to pretend to be a man!  it proves your desire to deceive...
i ain't got no fuckin' ring.
no! if we land this plane anywhere else, we will end up another entebe.  the americans built a super plane that flies through mushroom cloud, evades missiles and...  refuels in mid-air. call the white house.
so, you have accepted the truth.
this is another victory, my friends. what began with the lash shall be concluded with a caress.
no, ma'am, i'm afraid that's extra.
i'm sorry, sir, i have no intention of making light of this committee. and i have no intention of incurring your wrath, mr. chairman. i have a few friends who have already incurred your wrath. they've sent me letters from jail.
so long, fellas. drop in any time. the door is always open -- to my office.
well, how nice to see you again, elena. you're looking wonderful.
we do?
i don't believe in surrenderin'...i still got my sabre, reverend...never turned it into any ploughshare neither!
i'm not sure i hear a question in there?
don't you go to school?
dr. evil?
please.  talk to me --
oh, i didn't notice, where'd he go?
no.  did you?
how long have you been smoking?
in a magazine you come across a full-page photo of a nude girl.
hey, you smell that?  smells like something died.
his name's kevin mccall. every metro captain agrees that he's their top sharp-shooter and most likely to succeed.
monday?
what are we gonna do with this stuff anyway? heroin? what the hell do you do with heroin?
there guys are walking around with different halves of the same dollar bill?
not a bad idea.  if our horses get tired they can ride your men for a change.  now, i don't mind letting you have our horses, but you must promise to put them through their maneuvers.
i am your best friend. i am a lifesaver and a heartbreaker...
you look better without make-up.
yes ... yes.  that would be a great asset.
the problem is, emmett, you killed the wrong mckendrick.
-- yesss?
i'll bet a couple of hundred.
you've had a pretty tough break at that. twice a missus and still unkissed.
...fine. fine. well, you might want to drop by the annex when we open, update your suit--'course, you're in the smock all day.
i don't know.
what?
you want three big macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie.
i didn't tell you everything.
i can't take much more of this.  the pace is killing me.
no loyalty.
you are such a sweetheart.
no?
oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.
it will be fine. you have another.
be it fit for your wife, green jack?
whozat?
i know you, lionheart. i watched your mind work, heard your dirty thoughts --
did she say that?
out where?
yes. should i take her, louis? among her dolls? make a doll of her in turn?
perfect opportunity for you to demonstrate your continued worth.
you saw a forgery.
all i'm asking you to do is listen.  "the heavens made a girl named chris, with hair and skin of gold to touch her would be paradise to kiss her glory untold."
then i'd think there must be a reason.
okay, what?
something for burns.
little bit.  yeah.
exactly that.
i think you gave me too much time, captain.
i'm a "dorothy".
so at the intermission i can listen to the ball game. do you know that mother is seeing a prominent divorce lawyer?
he was your friend.
not me.
...young boys, still...?
yes.
that doesn't mean you do. you can't possibly trust him, he's... perverted.
...what difference would...
that's what i thought until you came riding in.  i saw your car over at the gas station.  it's a cool car.  want to take me for a ride?  desert's kind of lonely this time of day.
we need another one.
they workin' for anybody?
good news travels fast....
excuse me, adele?
marlowe? oh yes, he is the one, lovely waistcoat, shame about the poetry.
what if he did?
why'd you help me back there with the chief?  why'd you stand up for me like that?
and it's bullshit. and if i'm right, are you going to put the journal's reputation behind a story that's going to blow up in your face?
oh god, just get it over with.
oh yes, of course!  i thought you meant him!  you know it seemed a bit daft me havin' to guard him when he's a guard ...
the thing is, joel, whatever it is you think you have with this chick, once the thrill wears off, you're just going to be joel with the same fucking problems.
gettin' up, carr.
yea, of course.  now where could they have put it?  on thursdays, i'm sort of lost around here.
i keep waiting for the next novel to come out. anything in the works?
i want to get money for you and the baby.
are you sure?
i will not have it butchered.
a g...g...g...
could i borrow your guitar? i thought i might be able to cheer her up.
the gentleman has nothing contraband.
yes, but i lent it...
don't touch that.
i am looking for michael simonovitch iranoff.
what i need is a nymphomaniac.
what is it?
this is not a place for fun and games! this is rehabilitation! now get to it!! we at mac have a trial to go to!
she didn't write to me, did she.
private?
wade.
hoagie.
just had to be sure.
yeah, i'll work on it, too.
[we did voice analysis of the last five high profile kidnappings, including the little girl. the same man 'the dreamer'. listen to this.]
i -- just want to say i'm sorry.
yeah. look honey, i'll be right in. i just...we're just taking care of some groomsmen last minute business.
well, yes, in austria where be conducted the royal orchestra.
talk louder. i can't hear you.
i'm getting out of there. right now, diz. right now. bonus or no bonus. i'm gonna clear outa that office-- everything i own--my extra hat-- everything--
wild, isn't it?
what are we doing here?
you're becoming more human all the time, data. now you're learning how to lie.
yeah, i knew it.  i knew it from '69 on, and i said it all along, didn't i ...
victor, please, don't go to the underground meeting tonight.
but...  give it us here, you dozy sod. you hide and get the guns ready. wait until they are well in, then give it to 'em.
i couldn't believe it either...
everything you say sounds reason- able. but there's also a reason- able explanation for the opposite.
make any money?
what do you know about hypnosis?
sqweeep.  we innerup this programme to bring you this special news bulletin --  "aliens from reticula 3 have hijacked patrick peet and injected moly headcheese into his skull filling his entire brain cavity with cosmic slop..."
where did the vehicles stop?
how many?
i don't grow up any more. i just get older.
temple, i caught your act the other night and -
you didn't, jimmy.
i'm not thinking about your future, paden. i'm worried about stella.
megan, my deputies have more important things to do than look for camp counselors with car trouble.
i think you’re one of the bravest people i’ve ever met.
you'll know everything in a minute. get the champagne.
it always is.
is there a green elephant standing beside that bwana?
it's important.
you'll be sorry.
they said because the detectives were working for the department of the interior --
i was the more deceived.
she's alright, nels, thanks for asking.
and be poisoned out here in the open?
let me see the files.
they insist they wanna go with meeting him at the airport.  i told'em they're wrong, i can't convince'em. they're concerned that the last kid had the <u>wheat</u>. variations include, the kid is a <u>boy</u>, the kid is <u>twins</u>, it's a little <u>dog</u> ... they rub meat on schumann's cuff, the dog runs to him...
oh, cole, please. please come out of it. what would i do without you?
fight club was the beginning.  now it's out of the basements and there's a name for it -- project mayhem.
they been keepin' a folder on me cuz of my stomach. like how it was just before we'd play ball back in school. thought it was just some tic i got, or ulcers like my daddy had.  i can't... shoot. target practice i'm a pro. i tag between the numbers each time but...  but when there's really loud noises around me... somethin' happens. i get shaky and... i lose my breath. they called it anxiety. severe anxiety. it can be fixed and all... just not in time for....  it's a long process but... they sent me home.
listen, i don't know what's going on or how you got mixed up with him, but don't you let that self-righteous son of a bitch push you around, okay?
or your fucking wife, jerry.
forced what?
do you have any idea how much superheroes get paid?  zilcho. urban vigilantes with secret identities operating outside the law. not exactly the stuff of a w-2 form.  if it wasn't for merchandising and corruption and these diabolical "missions"...there is no such thing as heroes and villains, anymore, selina.  there are only winners and losers. you lost. we won.
just say it - you'll see. it's very serious. em iram!  em iram!
of course.
in love?
what's wrong with him?
yeah!  he'd kill for you dave.  he likes you.  your mind.
she was about to get married again. she locked me out of the bedroom last night.
i am captain renault, prefect of police.
hardly.
the females have eggs....
and i don't even know your full name.
stop shitting me, man!
i told you, 'watch it'.
i don't know what that means.
jesus chri--  we're on a very slippery slope here, sam.  a covert military operation riddled with civilian...
got anything to drink in there?
it sure would have made attractive headlines: great star kills her- self for unknown writer.
it's okay.  i have my senior lifesaving card.
are you kidding? i'm not going to tell them.
you want to talk about regrets, you're talking to the wrong person.
i couldn't stop eating steak. i felt out of control -- like i was making up for all those years being a vegetarian. i couldn't get enough. and then gregory walked me home... and he peed in front of me.
and we'll digest our food better.
that's what i do.
so that's why we can't get along? because i'd rather shoot a "dumb" jump shot?
yes, it's unholy.
it's ethics. i put evil men behind bars, but the law has miles of red tape and loopholes for these... cocksuckers to slip through. i've found out there are these two young men who fix the situation with an iron fist. as if they have god's permission. but what they do is wrong and i should arrest them... technically.
that depends on you.  christ, look at you.  i give you this easy duty until i can get you an assignment... all you have to do is eat ice cream and watch soap operas... and you have to make it rambo's last stand.
am i in charge of this thing?  or not.
skip and i wouldn't have got together if it weren't for you. that's a big deal.
thank you.
of course...
again
no, i really don't.
atlantic city?
go ahead. i can't reach. 2000 feet!
that's what you're buying. put it in your pocket.
one night only. she's buried in the morning.
but it's my own brother they're askin' me to finger— and johnny friendly. his mother and my mother was first cousins. when i was this high he took me to the ball games... .
neither am i.
no, doctor.  she seemed to get better, then about six months later she began to complain of pain in her back --
and in return?
oh, yeah.  so what're you gonna major in?
well... well, the cliché about the security of it, that's really true. we own a house, and i really like that, you know? and i like that john was just made junior partner, so he has a steady job and he's not some...
and if you had to guess ...
i've got no stomach for murder.
i'll go look....
i know the bhotani jib and chakobsa, all the hunting languages.
luke, i will not lose you to the emperor, as i lost vader.
yes. you may.  you there. what does munro call you?  the "scotsman" has sent one of his indian allies to guide you.
weight it.  if it's sixty pounds, it's three.  if it's fifty, it's two-point five.
fan-belt's shot.
he will.
there's an old vulcan proverb: only nixon could go to china.
you tell her, max.  come on, do her that favor.  tell her there isn't going to be any picture -- there aren't any fan letters, except the ones you write yourself.
that doesn't say a thing about t-rex, they could have been rogues.  robert burke certainly thinks they were.
jimmy, stay with me.
faith, this guy you think is mr. right, he's... not what you think--
i'm sure there's more than that... fucking pigs always travel in packs...  ...here, take this.
what do you mean?
how can you be sure?
i'm sorry about saturday, dad.  it was just impossible to get away.
no, 'fraid not.
basquiat, what did you take?
yeah?
you're kidding, really?
we read five times that you were killed in five different places.
jason...
no, just riding bareback, that's all. anyway, you might try the oak pass or stone canyon reservoirs. sometimes at lunch hollis takes walks around them. otherwise he'll be home by 6:30.
i don't think so.
come on.
i don't know if i can with my leg.
not exactly.
i like my work.
were you listening?  we got two officers in the hospital.  yeah, he's in restraints, plus the medic gave him enough stellazine to kill a horse.  look at him!  still on his feet.
stand there with your camera. i'll stop here so you get grauman's chinese in the backgrouns.
on a sauvignon blanc?
g-d, i'm stoned.  i'm stoned.  i'm really...
shut the fuck up, donny.  this kid is in the ninth grade, dude, and his father is--are you ready for this?-- arthur digby sellers.
are they sure it's a meteor?  it didn't come down like one.
it's paradise . we could be very happy here.
you're the nastiest dirtbag i know in this stinking city!
i oughtta report you.
no.  that's the weirdest part about it.
dewey?! ohmigod! where are you?!
and the fireworks. hand me that box, marty.
like the rock of gibraltar.
that'll be a nice little holiday treat.
we did this before.
yes.
because, right about now, the h.m.s. dauntless is lying in wait in the harbor.
nobody's saying they don't.
i'm not married.
how am i going to break this to bob hope?
dear, i was thinking.  why don't we go to paris next year?  i've never been.  your father, god bless him, wasn't much for traveling.
the traffic takes some getting used to.
what guards us against canada...?
not that i can see.  we'll know more once i get the lab reports back from seattle.
leave the pills. i'll take them later.
well? why aren't you there right now?
like fish he is.  i know enough about computers to put a phd to shame.  come now, brother dear, you didn't think i was going to let that little man run the show, did you? gus gorman telling us what to do -- i'd sooner kiss a pig!
a life form of its own; a conscious, living entity.
i used to go with the wrench.
i'd love to, it'll have to wait until i get back.  i have to leave.
don't you dare talk back to me!  it's bad enough that you've wasted your time with this absurd acting business.  but you deliberately deceived me!  who put this in your head? how did you expect to get away with it? answer me!
i can't. there's no junction due for at least 7 or 8 nanoseconds!
jerry.  and this is my associate cornelius.
the most vicious gang of thugs this city ever produced. twenty years ago they were casanova's personal bodyguard. but after he was busted they crawled into the woodwork.
you feel it, though.
yeah, my knee got folded about 90 degrees the wrong way.
let's not get excited, sir.
okay frank.
the words?
cuervo jones has more firepower than two armies. no one gets near him.
fuck you, george.  i knew you'd say something like that.  always thinking about yourself.
don't say my name.
i am? may i go now?
now, that's a brilliant answer. why didn't i think of it? our conversation could have been over long ago.
gay?
she's like this high, dark hair, skinny
that's what he wanted--a ten-year- old wife.  he'd come home from a war or a safari, and he'd wind up talking to the little kids.
i dunno. i know a place.
oil can....
hi. i made some brown betty. i sent floyd off to town with the boy. i said -  "floyd, i'm going to visit my girlfriend and spend the afternoon and that's all there is to it. he said who's going to make lunch? i said i'm taking a sick day. eat at the dinner." isn't that hilarious?  he didn't dare raise an eyebrow -- i don't even want to tell you how late he was out last night with those good for nothings from the sandford ranch. i am so sorry, honey, i let two days pass before i came by, but with the boy home the time just escapes me. have you heard from richard? how's the fair? god, it's hot.
sure.
ok!
shit.  i'm sorry.
should be one-thirty.
we can't do without you.  you're one of the foremost authorities on primitive pharmacology.  you're practically an institution around here.
he was wearing a suit.
can you watch the road?
my grandchild-baby.
use your influence with paul.  ask him to take that whiskey decanter off the dinner table.
what i do know is that whatever he's becoming, sid 6.7 is going to be even worse than he was before.
why don't you shut up, professor? just relax.
in a way  -- oh, it'll be a relief. i'm a wreck. no rest for the wicked, y'know. it wasn't enough, the radio frequencies, then i had to worry about getting to the missile and adjusting the aiming. so that if i could have activated the launch  -- well, lex luthor would've hit the spot.  there's a little place on route 190. dead on the practice optimum stress point of the san andreas fault. it wouldn't mean much to you, superman, but i call it...target zero.  pancho's taco palace...
it wasn't exactly a lie.
i don't know what that means. i'm talking about not rocking the boat.
why, there's nothing on the news?
real polite. kept calling me 'sir.'
hey, wait a minute. when am i going to see you again?
hmm? i dunno. chafing from the backpack, something.
too late...they want you.
i seem to recognize this routine. first the kiss then the touch.  oh, what's the use. you're you.
yes.
yes.
you wanna bet?
now that's a question. i don't know about your mom. for me, the problem isn't in the glass. the problem's in between my ears.
i want to try.
what will happen?
they guys here aren't going to be able to hold out until battalion shows up.
have you thought at all about your plans?
what are you talking about?
hell no. besides i'm just a radio call away if something happens. i feel i should keep abreast of what happens, seeing it's my jurisdiction and all.
and the snakes?  you want to know about the snakes?  you saw one outside earlier, didn't you?  when you thought i had deserted you -- you were terrified.
thank you.
naw, right here's okay.
what you wrote inspired me. _ 79.
jim jones, y'know.  i'm not drinking the kool-aid.
well, thanks a lot.
i’m finished here and i’m tired, emily. you shouldn’t be here. now don’t make it worse.
hmm.
my father.  william turner?
alright... i just wanna slow down bud... no more calls for awhile, no lunches... we suspend our business, alright...
four. you're great with these kids.
one of my people?
is this where no one stays?
it's a pretty cool place if you're a martian.
then take her to radio shack.
impossible?
and why the fuck would you do that for me?
what?!  what d'you think?!
jeffrey.
dinner? how dare you? i am a nobleman. i only dine with people of my own height.
why, you - you— look here - he may dash us to pieces!
look, betty, it can't be done. it's out.
and she began to cry.  and you put an arm around her.
it's a beautiful thing.
no.
what?
he hung it up.
goodbye, mr. gillis.
no, your grace! i mean with all humility, no. i would rather you dismissed me. it's obvious i don't satisfy.
here. you're gonna need this.
the president would support a reasonable request for an increase.
i know.
hey, cindy. your friend needs help.
he ended up moving back to milwaukee to live with his parents. i haven't heard from him in a long time. poor guy. i warned him.
no sense in going up there! i been here for hours. he ain't here!
under the house.
well, maybe i've asked advice once or twice or-or made a joke.
elena. my name's elena.
what now?
kobayashi.
what calls?  i haven't made any calls.
oh my god, sorry.  i'm interrupting.
war?  no!  i did not!  when you said compromise was possible i believed it was probable.  there's no middle ground at all?  we're the king's children!
please, if i start talking --
i was talking about us. working together.
give me some time to blow the man down!
this morning.
there is only one bed.
why haven't they killed us!?
well.  you have seen me.  now it is my turn to see you.  strip.
but i'll never win that.
i didn't have my camera with me.
where you been?
why you think is today?
it's all wonderfully under control, samuel- you've done a splendid job.
mrs. mulwray, it's a very serious offense pointing that at an officer of the law. it's a felony.
you know where i can get it?  i have a lot of money to spend.
someone wants to kill me, i’d rather die looking him straight in the eye.  what are you doing here?  looking for a woman a little more your type? how about that one?
i'm working it!  nothing's happening!
yes, you do. you always back down. you assume blame that isn't yours, you come in when called as opposed to enjoying your day off, you buckle like a belt.
that's a risk i'm willing to take. deep down, you're good.  even jade fox couldn't corrupt you.
nope.  maiden.
alright. meet me at the met.
i'm not scared, buddy.  you don't understand.  they're playing for keeps, buddy.  the press, the kids, the liberals -- they're out there, trying to figure out how to tear me down.
sure will, pal, sure will.
what's in the back?
why?
he's not gay.  i found out purely by accident, believe me.
israel doesn't have a king.
but why?
a witness to what...?
what's wrong?
yes, clarence. a man down on earth needs our help.
i did?
what do you want with us? i demand --
no, you get out of here.
it's not your fault.
you got a nice tan, though.
i'm not hungry.
where are you off to young lady?
what?
watch me.
i know, right?
same one.  i didn't know no impersonator.
and you are a fool.
will she scratch up your back?
oh god, oh god no.
shit. what have i done?  stall them! i'll meet you out back.
no, honey, we don't.  i'll make some coffee and start cleanin' up this mess. karl, you want some coffee, huh?
no, and believe me i've tried everything! i must have telephoned her a hundred times. i've sent her telegrams, i've sent her flowers... i asked her to dinner... i offered her seats for the opera...
the keys are supposed to be at the end of each level.  once we get all the keys, we can unlock arcade's heart. and then...
because i had too much pride.  too much integrity.  i wouldn't lick nobody's butt.  some material i refused to do.
[creasy is not a policeman. my sense is he could be very valuable to us.]
suave. goddam are you suave, you fucker. you want some beer?
hey drop it, okay?
you attacked me.
the charge is murder.
"happy birthday, wanda june!"
i'm telling you you're messing up the story, now get it right!
have they given you what i have given you? did they even try?
then i guess this is where we part ways. sorry.
it's not her fault, gill. she's had to take care of me all this time, cuz i'd just start throwin' up... choking. just losin' my grip. and she listened. she listened to me.  and... i got better. i don't get nervous like i used to. and since we been together... she been faithful to me. put all that junk behind her...
what?  is that what you're calling me about?
right across the bay there.
no, two yards from snyder, an' a grand from cappoli.
yeah, and ya gotta shoot at him for ten minutes.
i don't know his name. he's a friend of dick laurent's, i think.
that's all right.
duke forrest.
no, mom, i've turned it into dad's office.
this conversation is finished.
isn't he incredible, gets along with everybody.
-- not yet --
i must follow the slayers. they've taken lyssa.
let's not talk about that now.
how can you create beauty...with a selfish heart? the spiky insect-creature flies closer and closer around the little girl's head, buzzing angrily. her look of delight turns to fear. she tries to shoo the creature away. it flies off toward the thin membrane that encloses the city.
i have here a discovery that will startle the world. it's the vertebrae from the lumbar of a megatherium,[4] found in asia.
that's the one.  whatever happened to him?
good.
huh?
this guy.  where was he?
all right, mommy.
you call her up for yourself, angie. i don't feel like calling her up.
boogerland!
claude.
there's only seventy-eight.
that's another thing i can't do.
i looked at theo.  she had a look on her face.
go for a walk in central park --
then i'll tell you a story — a lovely story. do you know the story of rapunzel?
it was everything.
i'm sorry....i'm just so excited.  you must have felt this way when you first met anne, huh? where did you two meet?
good.
yes, sir. trust is a two—way street. in the past two years i've been pleased to note that you and mrs. kelcher have, uh, fulfilled your sacred trust of being good parents to the, uh, woman i plan to take off your hands.
she's a dental hygienist. she'll know what to do.
she's about the most beautiful girl i ever seen--i don't know if she's the nicest.
jody--
i don't know what pet name thorwald had for his wife. and that night he went out half a dozen times with the metal suitcase. he wasn't taking his possessions, because they're up in his apartment now!
mueller and childs. one of them must've taken the grenade from my pack on the chopper...
...i dunno.
at least.
what the hell do you think you're doing...?  what's going on here...?
nothing on 'em and two cups of mud; one while i'm waiting.
to pay for the next expedition, of course.
they're on autopilot.
how shall we find this cave, o tim?
i'm proud of you, sam.
sure.
there's somethin' funny going on around here.
well, i guess they'll just up an' run anyhow, them two.
you're the one, neo.  you see, you may have spent the last few years looking for me, but i've spent most of my life looking for you.
wonderful.  ran into a convention of auto dealers at the drake hotel.  you hear the one about the astronaut who comes back from the first manned flight to mars after two years?  his wife's got a year old kid.  so he says "all right.  who was it?  my friend harry?"  she says no. "oh, it was my friend sammy."  she says it wasn't sammy.  "oh, i suppose it was my friend lou."  "no, what's the matter, don't you think i have any friends of my own?!"
on the radio they say it's good.
you've got to get me out of here! six weeks -- sitting in a two-room apartment with nothing to do but look out the window at the neighbors!
day or night?
no, why?
have to.
nah, i don't do that anymore...
anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names. red menace, yellow fever, green revolution. that'd be a job, coming up with those names. how do you get a job like that? that's what i'll do. fuck the dole.
:no, i said, i hate what i'm doing to darcy. oh, boy, men are stupider, it's true.
... nothing.
shut up.
yes, that's why i brought it.
yes, i believe he did.
no, there. there's a good one. do you like that?
your name, please?
why you got me chained?
f for...
jessica. are you sure?
what?
really?
you can't prove it, can you? you're still trying to --  marriage license! did you say -- ?
i think i could cobble something together.  a long metal rod with a battery in it.  give it a hell of a shock.
i tell you what's cooking.  she made the blind see and it was a gift!  who was it from?  let's hear an 'f" for...
fame. my liquid hijack marlboros and the moon and the cow that jumped over it.
you pronounce it incorrectly. ni- notchka.
what's that supposed to mean?
watch me.
will it be fun?
yeah. take it.
where the hell is it?
he won't survive.  do you know what sort of life awaits you out there, taylor? that of an animal. if you aren't eventually hunted down and killed by apes, some jungle beast will devour you.
oh, pardon me. i obviously didn't convey my hesitation to take his story at face-value. no, you talk to me. but -- do me a favor? -- none of this demons crap.
where are the stockings he strangled them with?
you buy any of this, blair?
i certainly did.  i'd finish it too, but... i don't get out much.
it's ridiculous! i'm sitting here, listening to some asshole cracker compare his life to mine!
why not?
she took everything!    didn't even leave us cab fare.
i guess so.  you're a doctor?
goodbye, ted.  i don't want to hurt you.
good.  total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous.  let's play catch.
no.
your "briar patch" turned out to be more hospitable than i expected.
just <u>say</u> it.
all right. sorry, george.
tony.
it's going to be some fucking snowstorm.
because that's what it is.
good.  you have kids?
yeah, i've blown school out.
like i told you, half those horses are mine. i'm makin' sure they get to the ranch safe. so let's quit arguing and do whatever you figure on doin'.
that ain't my idea of friendliness.
thanks miriam.  say hi to henry and...
no wait. wait.
probably right.
it sure could, yeah.  thanks a lot.
jake.
so i'm gonna act!  ever since i can remember i've wanted to try it.  last summer i even tried to go to summer stock auditions but of course my father wouldn't let me.
what about breaking and entering?  are you wearing anything under that?
don't come any closer for a sec. this is gonna be kind of a shock... you remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
buddy, that was my place.
listen, there's an overpass coming up.  i may lose you for a minute.
after you, junior.
i sent andy out on murder missions. for god's sake -- it's the boston strangler, alber desalvo.  he used their own stockings to strangle them.  tied in a bow-knot.
schoolboy tings is you head. badness for you, badness for her, badness for me, lyin' here tumor, big as breadfruit, poison my inners an' waiting.
no, sir. they all been real straight with me.
it's like war of the worlds.
[beat] what?
i'm quoting my son, and he has never lied to me.
yawp!
shut up!  cough up the buck, ya cheap bastard, i paid for your goddamn breakfast.
if i accept that letter and you told a court of law i accepted it, they would interpret it as my having knowledge of his whereabouts. just wait kay, he'll contact you.
you think this shit's funny, ho?
tomorrow, he says.
check this out.
when was the last time you washed your hair?
have you had any dizzy spells this week?
i've never been to louisville.
i see things.  my worst fears.  you need to know something, peter.  i was possessed once.  like birdson.  it took father lareaux six days to pull me out of it.
wait a second. i'm the one who found out he was mucking around in here in the first place.
who did you talk to?
uneasy. dispassionate. bored. it's just getting hard to go to work in a good mood. i'm starting to think i've been in the business too long. last week i did a guy younger than me.
what do you care...?
they are fremen suits. i hope they fit well, my lord.
yeah.
no one. i didn't have the number.
you're a loser.
just forget about it.
and you crazy? he thinks shows like this are dumb.  if you didn't have an 800 number i could never get away with this --
was it worth it?
i know. i was there.
what exactly does that mean?
mulder -- what are you doing?
draw door?  i don't know why we keep looking in that stupid book.
and the guy saying he wasn't gonna take any more shit from anybody...
tyler durden!  tyler durden, you fucking freak.  what's going on?  i'm coming over there...
well we can't talk in here.  they're having the place painted.
of course! that's exactly what i want.
i think i've got it. once i get going, i'll be okay. but... how do i get started? i mean, i hardly know her.
not hungry. i want to get through this work in a hurry, and then i want to go home. what price did you get on those trucks?
what?
ok. so you were married for how long?
but your honor—
follow me my asian brother.
sammy davis, jr., honey.
shh! is that so hard to believe?
my point, dude, is why should we settle for twenty grand when we can keep the entire million.  am i wrong?
if i talk to you...y'know...if i tell you things...then you're a lawyer, right? you can't say things, you can't tell anyone, it's like the privelage, right? attornery-client, you understand?
that sounds to me very remarkable.
well, what should we do?
dickie hasn't killed himself. i'm sure of that. there's a private detective on the case now -- a mr maccarron -- dickie's father's employing him.
go away, curtis. if you can't knock, i can't hear you.
you did?
how are we doing?
sorry, captain. the ribbon has already entered the galaxy. it will pass through this sector in approximately thirty-one hours.
why don't we go over to the theatre and see what's really happening? after all, we've only heard from a small portion of the audience. let's hear what the majority thinks.
i'm going too. they may need a doctor.
no.
doesn't matter -- we're already at light speed.  and when we get back to the colonies, they'll pick us up in the network.
hand me a towel.  i'm getting out.
i felt somebody had read my book and was playing a game.
no, i didn't hear anything.  no, we're okay.
oh, we gonna be friends now?
will you guys relax?  we are on the threshold of establishing the indispensable defense science of the next decade - professional paranormal investigations and eliminations.  the franchise rights alone will make us wealthy beyond your wildest dreams.
his name is maurice.  he's dancing around everything else.
don't lose sight of him. this is the most important thing in my life.
always - like tits on a pig.  i wish i had a million of those bimbettes.
... don't explain.
you're a moron, you know that?
it was hot, yes.
we're not looking to arrest the man, faith, we're trying to locate him.
he was just doing his job.
we're coordinating with palmdale p.d.. we'll have your sorry ass covered.
let me finish, dear.  you had your say, now let me have mine...
what?  they ain't there?
deb, i want to throw you a shower.
my god...  ...how is that possible? you have to help me, doctor yolander. i don't know what i'm dealing with here! they've dug up my wife...
what, i'm sorry i said that.  forget i said it, it's what i thought i meant, but forget it.
mario, jose - they wear names like you and i wear clothes.  today the name is candy, tomorrow it's butsie. i wish i could help you, jim.
yes.
a real mamma's boy that one. dissed his mamma and he nearly threw a tantrum. little good it did him.
no killing?
honey, i have a little secret to share with you.
there's something you have to know, gretchen.  everything is going to be just fine.
maybe that's the only way to get through. besides, six heads'll be better than one.
i beg your pardon?
get down to word processing. help jamey look.
i think it started in the wind. money - arms, big oil, pentagon people, contractors, bankers, politicians like l.b.j. were committed to a war in southeast asia.  as early as '61 they knew kennedy was going to change things... he was not going to war in southeast asia.  who knows? probably some boardroom or lunchroom somewhere - houston, new york - hell, maybe bonn, germany... who knows, it's international now.
yeah.
how can you know this?
who?
my mare is saddled and ready; who's the captain's second?
all right, forget it.  tony, you got anything we can put on his face?
please, call me mordechai.
then, why don't you just die.  i'm going.  they'll find your body years later, the old recluse lady, she ate cat food, ten years of the new york times, unread, piled on top of the unread mail, the tv still on.  make up your mind.  live or die.  i'll get coffee.
turn the light on.
well, i'm only trying to get you outta this.  i told them you were in vietnam, you always had good jobs, you were with goldwater at the '64 convention, but you had marital problems...
he has a little dog.
edward, if the three of us sit down together we might as well announce our plans in the wall street journal.
you can't.
you comin' to l.a.? when?
then don't let him be seeing you talking to me. i don't want him twisting my arm off.
see there. thinks of the simplest thing first.
sure.
expensive hangover.
yes. you've made yourself quite clear.
then don't.
you'll beg for mercy in a second.
half-red, half-black--
that's all, sir.
who was that person mother?  was it you?
buster.
i ain't got a hat.
danger? why should i be in any danger?
yeah, well, we have the, i mean, they were just a terrific audience, i mean, you know, it makes it really easy for me, because i can be... huh?
i do.
that what they call you?
then why are you here?
yes!
no. no...
my boss, probably.  who would you fight?
flo, i'm just gonna help myself to a refill on the coffee.
where, amy? where do you see her?
you always live there?
but you won't get that splatter effect.
go ahead, jay.
i don't want you to look up. there's someone on the skylight.
commissioner gallagher said...  ...twenty years is a long time.
emmi, stop! i want to show you something. let me show you something and then if you want to leave, you can leave, please please. his friends, they did this. and he gave them birthday concerts.
what is it with women and catwoman? men have the courtesy to punish the weak, but women love punishing the strong. don't get me wrong--this catwoman is a terrifying, subversive menace to everything this community stands for and she must be stopped. it's just, i like her a lot.
i don't...
why didn't she put'em out?
then how come last night i heard you talking to logan and you were crying?
we're here.
when you've been in the system as long as i have, you hear many promises... many reassurances...many brave plans...
you were taken for a buggy ride?
does this dog here belong to you?
that's a skeleton key.  it'll open any door in that house.  will you give it to your father?  and you might mention that i single-handedly decorated the house.  in case he needs advice in that area.  come see me.
i didn't. but i had to try.
je crois qu'on fait une erreur de le prendre avec nous.
in other words.
a cowboy come in sayin' you killed quick mike in the shit house at the bar t...
-- how would <u>you</u> like to be in a horrible situation like that?
i'm looking at you.
no. you saved me from this fanatic. maybe i can pay you back.
vada, this is an adult writing class.
no matter what you think, you did come up with something unique. open it.
what'd you do?
i was going to ask.
yes, your majesty.
what?!
you mean, while i'm here.
it's the most beautiful city i've ever seen! what is it?
i feel so ineffectual. is there anything i can do for you?
he said one other thing.  it wasn't very nice.
must be what we came for. the four stand slowly and enter through the doors, which close behind them.  they begin walking around  the waxworks, which appear gruesome. the first they spy is of a high school student with a letter  jacket on the verge of being hacked with an axe by and angry woodsman.  they give each other looks of  disgust and continue on.  the next is of a frankenstein-esque creature carrying a woman in its arms.  the  four are now roaming around the waxworks individually, with tony encountering what appears to be  a tribal indian pointing a knife towards a victim.  mark walks past a circus cart with some sort of werebeast inside, and then continues on to a staircase exhibit with a dead woman at the base of it.  on the  staircase is a zombie-fied creature.  we see china walking on the other side of a bandage wrapped man  pumping gasoline into a woman's mouth.  finally, we see tony walking up to a cottage room display.
sit down, jake.
how are your grades?
oh, she bit her dog, eh?
or course. you should come over to the house. the boys would love to meet you.
it's that song, harry!
oh, my gosh, everything! my trip out here, what we've both been doing, you know...
you should shit or get off the pot.
now, don't be paranoid, jeff.  about the direction of research here, we may have had our differences of opinion...
alright, i love you.
you don't want to know, believe me. but don't worry, i washed my hands...
but he's dead.
i'm sorry that i didn't build you a stronger ship, young rose.
uh. not exactly.
i know this sounds weird, mr. sutphin, but the department of motor vehicle's computer shows only one blue station wagon registered to a parent of any of mr. stubbins' pupils.
what about entrapment?
i must have fallen asleep. i was asleep when you got home, wasn't i?
i've still got mine.
try betty mayfield.  the mitchell case.
he could always make me laugh.
this <i>is</i> the most likely location--
[beat] what?
why?
no, it's another thing. i was going to write you about it, but since you were coming down anyway i thought i'd wait till you got here. what did dave wilkie have to say?
sshh. etienne will be angry if i wake him. he thinks i waste film taking photographs of the sky.
what?
well, the word is to get a title shot you have to cooperate with the people who control boxing, in new york. and they're saying that you don't cooperate.
what does that mean? you don't have any tomatoes?
brace yourself.  we've got about 12 hours worth if we close off the sections we're not using.
i don't know why. i just couldn't help it.
it's wonderful! do you think i'm ready? do you really?
mother . . .
you've been having quite an exciting time here, haven't you?  all those meetings and business deals and society people - haven't you been having fun?
harry?  can you copy?
no, it will turn out well.
yes you did.
i'll call.  i really will.
i told you.  she kills him.
susan - forget it. go get us a seat on the plane. now.
i remember that speech really well.
if tony says this is it, then it's it.
well, either they have a very liberal work-release program, or he's out, because he's here in l.a., looking for you.
you said in l.a., anything goes.
i put you on the floor.
a while.
we can start in the area where the robbery occurred.
i thought they came right past here ——
i don't believe that.
it's my daughter sofie... she's gotta problem.
no. of course you're not. you've just hurt your back. that's all. you're going to be fine. it'll just take some time.
looking for some foreign compound in the blood of that alien you dropped the other day.
oh yes, i'm sure dr. duval could. if we had the parts.
so the defendant was encouraged to hope.  or could have been.
okay.  if we could've, by some miracle, stripped ten years off your face, still couldn't have got the thing made. because i don't mean anything as a director, and your name doesn't mean fuck all anymore.  and the people that can hire you are afraid to, because they think you're phoning it in.  that you don't have... oh christ, sally.
anyone else?
if there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about, tell me, but i have to ask.  your husband... he committed suicide?
greeks?
oh, great, great.  yeah, and if anyone attacks us we can blink 'em to death.
but captain best is already known as a valiant soldier, and is famous as a man of fashion in london.  it is mighty well of you to fight farmers' boys, but to fight an englishman is a very different matter.
well, maybe you better look again.
do his job.
hey.
damn if i won't.
come on mark mark ah hell, why not.  i'll get the maid to write the essays
i'll tell him we'll take two.
so alone.
here. take your fifty cents back.
no.  no.
come on steven hook me up. do me this solid.  come on man. i gotta get darcy alone. she's gonna let me fuck her man. please.
she was very evasive.
well, let's do it.
just 'cause i'm not like little miss honor roll here--
i am not a doctor.
he won't do anything for me, but for you --
we came to stop you waking the gods, erik! but i didn't want anyone to get hurt!
i hate tears. 
did you ever dream that you were someone else?
there you go.  love you.
i fantasized about you.
it puzzles me so badly. i've done terrible things but i can't consider myself a terrible man. i've killed three people and i'd still want to say it was accident, do you see?
didya look at the border?
breaking out
well, just so you know.  i gave you guys the credit.
it's just money.
of course.
thanks.
you don't need a car you can't drive for a month. go see marvin.
it is all locked safe in here
we'll bury him.
we have to see this movie, dude!
yeah
i dunno, that lady sounded pretty sure...
get that car the hell away from here, now!  i spend a lot of money to keep the cops cool.  but this is the kinda shit that pisses everybody off.
we have become aware of these concepts only recently. in our dealings with sarris. often sarris will say one thing, and do another. promise us mercy and deliver destruction... it is a concept we are beginning to learn at some great cost.  but if you are saying that any of you could have traits in common with sarris.
you're quite serious about this, aren't you, buckaroo.  we know each other pretty well, i think.
is there a killer loose?
i's horned and raised here up till i's twelve year old.
oh, i don't mean the things you've given me - that don't mean anything to you.  what's the difference between giving me a bracelet or giving somebody else a hundred thousand dollars for a statue you're going to keep crated up and never look at?  it's only money.  it doesn't mean anything. you're not really giving anything that belongs to you, that you care about.
by whom?
and what was that?
so who did you think it was -- kris kringle? what was going on here last night?
you're crawling around like a--
that ain't no crime
what's wrong?
why not?
what's this?
well, that's why you got it.
i'm gonna save carmen.
possibly.
i'm hanging up.
yah.
dear me, the man is dense. this is a castle, isn't it? there are tapestries?
once their lives are in danger and you have the mob guy coming after them, it not only heightens the tension, it adds a wistful element to their love.
"...you have to believe in yourself..."
what does it mean?
you know damn well what we both make of it.
slow down, slow down.
turn around quick!
why?
unless what?
not a cent, i swear to god, i swear on my mother's eyes.
look, everything's going your way.
suck a dick, i left my purse...
oh my god!
frank's idea. he thought i should have notes so i did this right... maintained focus, didn't get emotional and tried not to terrify you.
look, i can help. you need a sensor expert. you've got one.
yes, sir.
oh.  well it wasn't us city people that did it -- your fine rosy-cheeked country boy.
...read it over, and think about it.
sir ? we're moving them right along as fast as we can.
i'll be glad to avoid the crush.
remember, skiers stay up longer.
that's crazy, dennis.  the cops will see us.
good. now if you'll just go along with mister washington, he'll see that you're properly oriented.
oh... i've just been thinking about something that man bytes said.
nods solemnly. gene reaches the platform and gives out an exaggerated sigh.
been away. up to houston.
i may have said something like that. but that's not how i feel at this moment.
is my credit good enough to buy you out?
maybe not, but he is and fucking him makes you an accessory. he stole your passwords.
you're, you're saying so you have to go in there tonight and...
well, there's not much time.
what is it?
so you have claimed. yet you have no explanation for this.  the locket last seen in the hands of the poor murdered child was found hidden in your dress the morning following the murder. the locket you so coveted.  how did it come to be in your possession?
now that it's out of your system.
he likes the quiet. they were here last week.
i say we tape him to a chair.
no pistol. ever.
ok. ssh. rest.
malkovich!
they got it an a long playing record now - music to string her along by. my wife doesn't understand me -- we haven't gotten along for years -- you're the best thing that ever happened to me --
i was desperate. it was gross.
you think you're my sister?
aaaaa! jesus! this isn't happening. i'm still hallucinating. shit!
i've kissed guys. i've just never kissed a guy. felt that thing--
what's gonna go wrong?!  i take your place for the royal inspection.  bala comes strolling down the line, she sees me -- <u>bingo</u>!  love is rekindled, and she takes me up to the palace for a little...  tea and crumpets... and you take your place again, and go march around to your heart's content!
the brooklyn bridge.
yes.  we won, that's right.
okay, doll.
yeah? display?
well, you've got a croc alright, they're keystone species.
to collect my fee.
someone is out there...  ...help, we're in here!
if there is anything else, don't hesitate --
after those cops, you'll never be able to come back to cleveland.
you'd do her a favor.
kaufman's a lying bastard!  if you sign him, i'll ruin you!
never have children.  if they're not a burden to you, they're a burden to someone else.
it's so great to be able to talk to a girl and not have to ask "what's your major?" i hate that.
is that what this is about? material wealth?
hm?  no, about a year ago.  i was working out of los angeles.
the press think that the white angel is a woman - why is that? do you dress up leslie?
maybe you'd better go after him - if you don't want to lose him.
i wanna leave. get me out of here.
how do you like your bath, sir?
what about me?
my astrologers assure me that the hour is p-p-propitious -- leo, with virgo rising.  have you ever noticed on the astrological chart how the virgin is next to the lion?
stanford. i'm leaving in june after i graduate.
i don't know. all i can see is a lot of blowing sand!
before "the change," mr. verger was... he made quite a study. 
who did this to you?
no, not yet. as i said, we're not sure. but... basically no one has seen or heard anything.
what sort of questions?
it wasn't difficult. only an apostate or a lunatic would flee to the forbidden zone.  i see you brought along the female of your species.  i didn't realize a man could be monogamous.
in here i am.
never mind that now. i also need some artillery, you know, a couple of sawn-off shotguns.
no.
i won't get lonely.
would you settle for pepperoni?
-- two million people plugged-in here.
even tough i don't talk to her every day -- i still talk to her every day.  know what i mean?
four.
no. me! me!
carlton insisted on leaving with her. maybe he got lucky.
just a scene i cut out.
that's good... who?
ha un numero di telefono?
oh.  my condolences.
more.
you’re jumping, sweetheart...
because you're tainted. the venom's still inside you. you could still turn on us.
they did?
seldom? no kidding?
oh god, jeffrey. is that you? oh god.
it wasn't supposed to happen like this.
but i feel you're extending this philosophy to real life.  it's obsessive.  nothing's ever on the level anymore.
question is why they sat here when the storm moved in.  check their stuff while i sniff around.
oh, no!
aw, i conned a senator from florida on a stocks deal.  a real lop-ear. he thought he was gonna take over general electric.  some chantoozie woke him up, though, and he put the feds on me.
plannin' on getting married?
you'll find out, general! and when you do . . .
how?
i doubt that. besides, i can't help myself. i'm just a figment of your imagination.
can't say, major... been squirrely all mornin'... fuckin' weird... sometimes i think that nose of his is too good... smells things that ain't there.
he's a freelance bio-exorcist. claims to get rid of the living. but he's a troublemaker.  he's pushy.  he's been sleazing around that cemetery for 500 years.
listen to me....you have no need to distrust me.  we're going....
but i swore. i promised john i wouldn't tell.
who said so?
well, i'll be damned. the barber! and i thought this trip was a bust. well...
i'm down, but for a worthwhile cause.
do you know who her doctors were?
you okay?
and i ain't no nigger either!
i just wonder how that happened.
let's have dinner first.
do we still get paid for the week?
the what?
maybe.
who?
of course -- i went to the muncie, uh, secretarial polytechnic!
more bullets in the gun... the trouble is that still leaves one of us with his hands tied up, so that means we gotta play each other.
well, you  said it yourself, earlier, and if i may rephrase, that the success of the president, in the polls...
are you going to yell at me?
right.  but there, pride comes first, not gluttony.  the sins are in a different order.
waiting for luis to call me. he said he'd call tonight. oh don't be difficult, patrick.
whose side are you arguing ...?  i thought that you wanted to do something.  i don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- no offense, but we all know where the money's going  to ... i have an interest in the hospital;  and i don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me.  they gave her the wrong anesthetic.  they turned the girl into a vegetable. they killed her and they killed her kid.  you caught 'em.  now: how many others did they kill?
well, what am i supposed to do?
oh, how do you mean?
i wasn't thinking about my mother's bathroom.
what?
is it that hopeless?
let's find you a drink.
army life is too dang easy, my feet have gone soft.  back home, we go out squirrel huntin', i walk forever and a day and then some, don't even raise a blister.
fuck this shit! i ain't dyin' in no white man's war! ise didi-ing this motherfuckah!
i have rejoined the army, and asked to resume my commission at the head of the troops of general fromberge.
...oh, did that hurt?
no.
you're--you're old friends of harold ryan?
it's all my fault. oh god. i wish i were dead.
i hate to disappoint you, pal, most-the time, that's how it is for users, too.
hallo.  my name's dick halloran. i'm the head chef up at the overlook hotel.
like, because someone's holding a gun on you.
no.  come in.
i don't know... i just think maybe i'm making a mistake...
you have a real gratitude problem. you know that, bruce? i need a name. batboy? the dark earl? what's a good side kick name?
probation, counselin', few days a week.
it's practically stamped on your forehead.
you saved me.
that's what you think. i drink tons of booze so you might get one of those scary neuter-babies that's born without junk.
not without you.
cute little old man, if you want a boy, i can be a boy.  and if you want a girl, i can be a girl.  i can be anything you want me to be!
that's the way of the world, little one. didn't they teach you that in school?
you've got me? who's got you???
you were going to drive me around. drop me at lax.  never be the wiser. but el gordo missed the elevator.  so we go to plan b.  pop the trunk.
yes.
how do you know what they're doing?
you did?
hell, now's the time to buy it off him cheap.
that's a wonderful jacket. let me guess, valentino couture?
we don't know that for sure.
the future, mr. gittes. the future. now where's the girl?... i want the only daughter i have left... as you found out, evelyn was lost to me a long time ago.
be right there, pop.  listen to what i said.
no thanks, i--
talk about dumb luck.  odds of anybody finding that girl, thirty years later. and then the chances of hitting a dental...forget about it.  bets part is she's the first victim.  she knew the doer.  i'm betting those bones are gonna do a lot of talking.
almost?
so long, darling. good-bye. take care of yourself.
mojitas...?
hey, just 'cause you're no good with a rope...
karl.
i guess i can only make you believe the things you want to be true, huh? like ol'		   * jimmy down there.
i don't know.
so i've been informed.
i will, thanks.
you're here quite a bit, then.
no! i have a boyfriend. he loves me.
something about my father?
this stuff is pointless.
exactly --
i forgot something--something at home. i'll see you later.
i love you, daddy --
i don't care what they're forming. i'm on my way and i don't like the idea of being stopped either.
where the hell did you learn how to deal? 
yeah, i got a urgent message for a customer named william jones.  drop everything, craig is in trouble.  come quick.  don't try to call.
no, but i told him i'd be at the town tavern next saturday night, and he sounded like he might come.
then so was mine...
shotgun. suicide. next?
and you've got cold feet.
i never said help us!
rosebud?
it's not the black beverly hills, it's the black palos verdes. anyway, this chick, elois, was a man-eater- upper. i bet every guy who's ever met her has jacked off to her at least once. you know who she looked like? christie love. 'member that tv show "get christie love"? she was a black female cop. she always used to say "you're under arrest, sugar."
what's going on?
three-cent stamp.
you jerk! you look at all the sweetness and light and goodness you think'll come out of this. you know what's gonna come out of this... the end of religion, the end of civilization, the end of the earth. we could become slaves, we could become a colony of these things. don't you see that? are you too stupid to see that?
andy!  you don't get it!  they don't want you back.
fair hair, sir.
charlie! am i dead?
you haven't switched it on.
better reassure him.
it's a very pleasant room, ben.
...yeah?
that right? shit. i used to run rigs for a guy loved your chaw there. shit rotted out his tongue, had to build him one outta silicon so the poor boy could talk. you ever see a motherfucker with a silicon fucking tongue?
i know.
gosh, if only we could find kat a boyfriend...
just what are you saying?
i think he just likes pointing at things.
don't stop now.
sport, indeed.
why?
sure.  no problem.  i'll just call up and tell him his favorite agent saw this one surfer moon another surfer yesterday and it looked real suspicious.  shit, he'll probably call out the national guard.
look, if you want to kill jews on your free time, fine. we need you to raise money. will you do that for us?
you can make it a little less brutal by knocking a million dollars or so off your salary.
in life, the decisions that haunt you are the ones where you just don't know... where right or wrong will never be answered.  years ago, the hungarians contacted me.  the government wanted me to come home, to be minister of culture.
then we're screwed.
but you're a friend of jimmy's. i think of you as a brother already.
do you know where they are?
don't give me this oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine.
my soul, woman.  i give you three murders and you aren't satisfied.
what exactly is he charged with?
the plants, from space.  their particles are still charged.  with the right amount of energy, those ions could <u>create</u> the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.
what?
i used to.
well, it seems to me...
well, albany's a mighty good insurance town. most people there take it out pretty early in life.
the <u>firehouse</u>...
you do and i'll die, martie...i will! i'll just die!
didn't know you cared so much.
you'll be hist...
you always say that.  then you go to work and forget you promised.
well, there's nothing we can do about it. why get excited?
i told you i'm looking for someone.
listen, i'll go in, create a distraction. have this...  may be able to hold them back long enough for the aliens to escape.
throw me the keys and i'll pull you up.
and it's this place. it makes no sense, but it spooks me.
the fight.
john wayne... listen, nick --
you are the most unbelievable woman i have ever met. one second you're a screaming banshee and the next you're florence nightingale. who are you? that's what i want to know. will the real jezzie pipkin please stand up.
why?
what do i do? i'm the vp of finance.
he was trying to kill me, not you.
i thought you said you lost your eyes in the war?
let's just say i could write a hell of a paper on a grown man who dresses like a flying rodent.
we got two paddles.
sounds like beverly hills.
my dad always drives my mom.
i call.
what?
that is not me.
okay. so you lost a great specimen-
oh, no!
i guess there's an exception to every rule.
uh, i probably will, but not you. you're too much of a butt-monkey. huh huh.
put some butter on it--or ice?
ta-da!
your reputation is secure, scotty.  mr. sulu, take the con. i'll be in my quarters.
aha! always got time to argue money, huh...?
shurrup, cheerful.
he's right, let's move. be quiet and get to the exit. pair up, grab the weapons.
snow shovel or anything or something.
i am, but i like imported whiskey. so there i am and i hear the biggest ole' coon you ever did hear, 'a rustlin' right there in front of me. that ole' boy comes right out of the brush, i got a clear shot and he knows he's 'bout to meet his maker. i aim, i got my finger tight on the trigger and then i just smile and say to that ole' coon, go on, now, you get out 'a here.  then i sit down on a hollow log and take me a right long pull a' that mash whiskey.
he thinks that i am a gentleman and that you are a lady!
'...but sid, let me urge you to work closely with the new president, and to keep giving hudsucker industries all your energies -- but not your soul. for while we must strive for success, we must not worship it. long live the hud. waring hudsucker...'
what are you gonna do?
we reinvented ourselves.
je peux l'ouvrir tout de suite?
you're the best?
my pleasure.
my client can't walk, your honor.
gee, i used every frame of film we shot.  maybe they won't notice.
i think i should come with you.
i don't know why i said it. i'm sorry.
i got to know.  there is never any room for "personal"...
i don't think that's such a good idea.
i don't doubt that the queen was highly amused.  she has always had a very healthy sense of humor.
he knows the first mrs. kane socially -  that's the answer we got.
we're only going one way.
aunt theresa, you got this big house here. i mean, you got this big house just for you and marty. and i thought maybe tommy's mother could come here and live with you and marty.
all you need is love. john lennon. smart man. shot in the back, very sad.
yes?
so this is what, a test?
is it because of anna?
i'm not a gambling man.
been to toronto. my mother was born there.
the only thing wrong is the cheap, softcore crap you're peddling, eddie.  where do you get this stuff?
they'd have a good neighbor, jabez -- and that's worth much more than anything else -- much, much more!
these ain't strangers, they're neighbors. this only picks up signals in a half-mile radius.
it's obviously based on elliot and me.
you bastard...
an animal that doesn't procreate. it spreads, grows. a living disease.
you're not going anywhere. except back to nowheresville. you're too impatient, selena. look around you--all these people have served years and years of apprenticeship. some of their families have been in the craft for generations. you can't join and take over our whole organization in a few months.
can there be some mistake?
you expect me to believe that?
the english??
as you wish...
let my kid go.
what was it?
no, i know, but... but, you know, i'm all perspired and everything.
yes. why is that so difficult for you to understand?
okay.
not at all. captain renault's signature is necessary on every exit visa.  captain, would you think it is possible that herr laszlo will receive a visa?
...to get her heartbeat back...?
ever done anything like this before?
i think you ought to know what our chances are. the life of everyone on board depends on just one thing: finding someone back there who not only can fly this plane, but who didn't have fish for dinner.
--but you can do my o-chem lab in under an hour, you can--
nietzche...
jean baptiste!
i was desperate.  i knew you wrote about murders.  i needed a way in.
i don't know.
yeah, sure. er, you know grubbel, for instance.
frank, you animal, i love it. i'll have the story by thursday night, i swear to god.  i hope.
just a minute.
i think not. i have seen the lady. and if he did not leave her in marseilles, or in oran, he certainly won't leave her in casablanca.
allie, i know exactly why you're doing this.
you better believe it, you sweet little thing. you better believe it...
osaka.
can't you give me something?
maybe he's hungry.
cause i'm not getting any better. it's a waste of time.
yeah, i would think so, too.
what?
it involves your brother. he... took advantage of me.
a man couldn't ask for a squarer shake.  let me have billy van cleve...  don't ever tell anyone, susie, how i'm tied to your apron strings...  billy!  j.j.!  what's this about that boy?  what boy?  where are we, lug, in a drawing room comedy? you're brain is warming up, sweetheart - yeah, dallas!...  no, don't explain your point of view, but...
nothing, go back to sleep.
it's a fetish of mine.
'cause he just ate a cow, you stupid--
he said you lost something.
she could use some mascara and some serious highlights, but she's not completely unfortunate-looking.
i know.  just did what you had to. that banner and stuff, that's just ike.  don't worry about it.
oh wow, a real evil canieval.
crowd control. crowd control. wake up, guys.
neither does he. he looks vietnamese.
wick.  they got your crew, too?
plan two: here come the waterworks.
my pleasure, jody
uh - right. sure. the mets are gonna win tomorrow.
if it isn't straight by now, son, you probably should see a doctor.
after the thanksgiving i had, i need it. you having one?
he doesn't look familiar -- but then he'd probably be easier to identity with his head.
no we don't. but that's where we're going. from minden we take a stage to reno, then another one over to auburn and another one to placerville. then it's a day's trip to sonora.
so i hear. you've also been smoking a lot of marijuana, i understand.
which?
i didn't say shit.
pardon me, but are you okay?
i'm sorry he got those birds.
-- yes, sir, it's confirmed --
i know how it feels to be dead.
if there's a civil rights violation. but generally we let the local police and da do their work first.
are you kidding? tell me you don't want a slice of that pie right over there.
you...  ...fell into the bay.
mr. president, this cannot be breathed!  especially to our secretary of state -- that cretin rogers ... the chinese would never trust us again. the only way, i emphasize only way, to pull this off is in secret.
you thought the "customs agents get blown up" and "smuggling" and "ricky tan" and you put it all together and came up with a five year old case. that's why you didn't tell me what we were doing...
well, dionne warwick, guess his home town.
no.
i can't see you tonight.
my arm!  he took my fucking arm!
haka xuki. what's that mean?
don't touch it! get back in that tub!
that would be inconceivable.
yeah.
can you tell her i'll ring her back.
you don't know me at all.
yeah. see you later.
you never - ?
sure. no problem.
you got any books in there?
he's comin' back? what for?
there are caves in those mountains.
no.
yes.
at least you're safe.  what about the others?
i want to, palmer -- more than anything.  but it has to be real. it has to be true.
you know who you're fuckin' with?! huh? do you?!
i just know, that's all. i remember you from central.
i ain't no preacher anymore.
you've heard the rumours they're going to resettle us in the east?
opening up just a little wouldn't kill you, ya know.
hey, <u>you're</u> getting the big bucks....  i think we're up-and-running...
that's their job, isn't it?  to argue.  so, i think my case will be long on talk and short on action.
maybe the treasure's a chest full of apples and bananas!
wood?  ward?  wood.  hey, what do you know.  it <u>is</u> wood. dang secretaries, you can never get a good one.  right?
you need the words?
is that right?  think you're gonna make it with her?
yeah i want something.  i want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
yeah...how'd you know?
i'm not listening.
i don't know.
oh, nothing out of the ordinary. growing old.
it was kind of like clicking, maybe a language wasn't it?
you want me to tell her for you?
i got eggs down here!
lili... i love you!
great.  god, i've wanted you forever.
shee-it, you know, i got this thing all figured out, ratso. i mean rico. when we get to miami, what i'll do, i'll go to work. i gotta do that, 'cause see, i ain't no kind of a hustler. i ain't even any goddam good as a bum. i'm a nothing, that's what i am. so reckon i'd better go to work and get me a goddam job. okay?
i'm sorry.  i'm just not in the mood for company right now.  here.  take this map.  i need you to find all the secondary roads to mexico from oklahoma city.  i think we should stay off the interstates.  we're too conspicuous.
if you want to know 'what it's like to be a child', you need to learn how to play...
fixing it?  but i fixed --  where'd you get all that?
ordell called and wants to meet me and i'm scared.
phasers on stun. move out.
why would i string y'? they were sweeties until a month ago.
you'll be fine.
i have a loft.
i have a pretty good idea.
something came over me, i just had nail him, no matter what the				* risk.  it was pretty hairy.  i thought he had me, a couple of					* times.  but i really can't take credit .  .  .
we can change our names.
is it contagious? 'cause everyone agrees my immune system's way down.
...going to war...
if you can, send me a receipt.
after all i've done for you --
then what did you do, play canasta?
jesus, that's in chinatown, ain't it?
yes, thank you.
your only mistake is that you didn't dump her first.  diane court is a showpony.  you need a stallion, my friend.  walk with us and you walk tall.
corporal hicks!?
i can dig that. bittersweet perfection. dogs of lust on leashes of memory... yeah.
and i'm going to eat his breakfast cereal, too, even though it tastes like boogers. and...and...
maybe i can help you find him. i know a			* lot of people.
i...
what do you want?
all right, but....  ...you're so damned ugly!
i dunno, duke. i kinda liked it.
how do you control the morlocks?
because it's murder we're talking about. aren't you concerned about what she told us about the other person in her room.
no.
it wasn't one thing, if that's what you mean.  i just... i can't live here anymore. i can't live where stupidity is embraced and nurtured as if it were a virtue.
shut the fuck up.  ricky.  you have a mean streak in you...  and what the fuck are you babbling about...? 
you could've broke it to me gently, you know; at least started by telling me you had a boyfriend. i told you i have a girlfriend.
yes.  throw it in.
on my knife.
yes, robert. i know about the president.
just a manner of speaking.
okay.
why do they care about our maps?
i don't want to hear anymore.
sir.
marla... i need to talk to you.  it's going to take a tremendous act of faith on your part for you to hear me out.
i doubt it! come on, ken.
bomb doors circuit is green, bomb release circuit is green, bomb fusing circuit is green.
and he didn't have them?
anytime.
well they really didn't go into any details on the phone, but they did ask for you, and i figure we should try to help them out as best we can.
do you remember the last time you and i danced under the stars?
this way, mister mcmurphy.
misty, that's a terrible thing to say!  detectives, it's time for you to leave. my wife knows nothing about this terrible... accident.
let the machine get it. i have no desire to talk to anyone who would be calling me...
you remind me of someone. you from the west coast?
the five in question are third generation nexus sixes, constructed of skin-flesh culture, selected enogenic transfer conversion capable of self-perpetuating thought, para-physical abilities and developed for emigration program.  are you with me?
what are you going to use for money?!
yes.
that's it.  that's it.  that's all i need to know.  bless you, thank you, thank you.
yes -- when their troubles can harm them.
you think people ever commit suicide out of happiness?
i said "sorry, wrong room" and walked away.
hm.  well, i like you, too.  i like your aunt.  i like your shoelaces. i like--
oh, now--that won't do--
no.
that's right.
it's crazy, man. instruments are crazy. we're gonna have to eject.
did he say anything else about her?
okay, i'm nuts.
i mean, there's no instructions--  what do you mean, they're not tricks?
numbers? no, never mind.
if you close your eyes and listen to our voices we might be in paris.
it had an alarm.
yes.  we won't be able to have dinner tonight.  something's come up.  i hope you don't mind.
ooooo, you are smart. just don't get too smart.
can't!  can't!  can't!
we don't have anything straightened out.  you're uptight about something ...what's wrong?
you're going.
and me coming in with two pair-- 
try and control this ...
dana bought it when we went antique shopping. she said it didn't go with her stuff, so she gave it to me... she thought it fit in better with my "old time thingamajigs."
we be honored, friend ogg.
what do you do?
nothing that won't heal by dawn.
you're not using the same guy who tried to fix it?
it's a surprise, you see.
i'm not going to be drawn into this.
choices?
then tell them i had a seizure.
all this blood is scaring the shit outta me. i'm gonna die, i know it.
upset.  no.  i never get upset about business.
'night.
what is your position ?
everything that's been missing.
before they kill somebody else, too.
are you totally stupid?  what does it look like?
what?
the corridor nullifies our number... and no one has stomach to fight the captain.
don't move me.
hey, anytime.  actually, no.  this was enough.
a long way from home. you be careful out there.
yeah.
lloyd. i never have any, and he likes a couple of drinks after we finish - so he sent it up...
i don't know.  80 or 90 minutes, tops.
yeah.  yeah. it bothers me a lot.  'cause, you see, twice, sarah -- once at ames with minnesota fats and then again at arthur's...  ...in that cheap, crummy poolroom... now, why'd i do it, sarah? why'd i do it? i coulda beat that guy, i coulda beat him cold. he never woulda known. but i just had to show 'em, i just had to show those creeps and those punks what the game is like when it's great, when it's really great. you know, like anything can be great -- anything can be great... i don't care, bricklaying can be great. if a guy knows. if he knows what he's doing and why, and if he can make it come off. i mean, when i'm goin' -- when i'm really goin' -- i feel like...  ...like a jockey must feel. he's sittin' on his horse, he's got all that speed and that power underneath him, he's comin' into the stretch, the pressure's on him -- and he knows -- just feels -- when to let it go, and how much. 'cause he's got everything workin' for him -- timing, touch. it's a great feeling, boy, it's a real great feeling when you're right, and you know you're right. it's like all of a sudden i got oil in my arm. pool cue's part of me. you know, it's a -- pool cue's got nerves in it. it's a piece of wood -- it's got nerves in it. you feel the roll of those balls. you don't have to look. you just know. ya make shots that nobody's ever made before. and you play that game the way nobody's ever played it before.
yes -- oh -- oh -- yes, -- 
ok. well call me when you get back, i mean, i'll call you when i get back. i'll be back for three weeks and then i go away for a month after that. so maybe in that time....
'taken.'  that's nice.  when i had someone taken i would call our general contractor, transfer the money and as soon as i hung up the phone i forgot about them.
have fun at work.
don't talk like that.
this guy, on the johnny carson show.
you can't listen. you can't watch either.
let's just say greg likes tackling tight ends on and off the field.
no, no, no, wait!
pierre cauchon, bishop of beauvais. as you were captured in my diocese, the duty of conducting the trial falls upon me.
catch you later.
you know, i had a crazy dream last night. it was about you.
the situation is, my man cameron here has a major jones for bianca stratford.
still.  you must be rich.  making a couple of famous movies like those.
we're dealing with tracy and hepburn here, a very sophisticated pair.  we must protect them, treat them with respect, <u>nur</u>ture them.
no... it was a seven letter word.
okay. hang on to these.
it's nice to do a lot of things.
i need flesh and --
because you refuse to believe she's serious. you've always refused.
i don't want to talk about it. everything's okay now. i don't want to talk about it.
i make thirty-one thousand dollars a year.
absolutely.  the audience will stain their drawers.  i did.
no.
we could get a million dollars.  we could get it in cash.  i know where it could be gotten.
they're ready and waiting.  you'll soon be with old friends.
death first!!
them whores, they been fuckin' an' fuckin' all them cowboys that come into town the last two weeks...
we were told you could "fix us up."
you mean with you and that woman chained to ya radiator?
what is this? where's reed?
then just wait -- maybe this whoever's got you next on the asylum's equipment- test list. maybe a literal mind-blow inside the "saturation chamber."
yes?
nothing.
hey, woody!?  where'd ya go?
i'm sure i can come up with something.
margo.  margo, i want you to know how sorry i am about this...
well, you see, the old chap is pretty anxious to open on schedule. all of his advertising announced the opening tonight.
yes, sir.
how many kilos can we fit in these planes?
about an hour ago.  said he was more than happy to cooperate.
you heard me.  count it out.
i see.
ten days ago?
and how did he do that?
oh, not much.  gates just had his tonsils taken out.  the hard way.
i'll watch.
would it help any if i could persuade him to meet you?
with the priest, you liked them scrambled.  with the dead head, fried. with the bug guy, poached.  now it's egg whites only, thank you very much.
get going, will you, brady -- before i get mad!
he's not!
they're withholding payment.
we're only one payment behind. i argued with her. it isn't right.
oh. michael's 17 and carolyn's 16.
some kid hittin' .300 in lynchburg ...probably a bust.
paulie was just talking about him.
listen neil, i appreciate your interest in me but i'm not like you.  when you say things, people pay attention.  people follow you.  i'm not like that.
i don't know.  it would be small, easy to transport and hide.  gold or jewels. probably gold.
i've been assigned to write an article about you for the school paper. it was either a feature on you or the new four-color ink pens at the student store.
i had to see you...
you ever think about gettin' remarried?
that's right on time.  this is my friend, vito.  his pops is sal.
yeah. it could get better.
you just did.
say "mmmerrick."
yeah.
how can it be bullshit to state a preference?
how about art.
heaven knows. a lot.
well, you tell her majesty from me, if her husband was here now, he'd have had her out of that house and getting some air in her.  what the hell's the point in me being here otherwise?!
--cotter: shut up.
you're not going to tell me that.
i have an aunt, you see. aunt tessa. she's seventy years old, and veddy prim and strait-laced.  she's coming back from europe at the end of the month, and i'm going to give her a myna bird that'll talk to her.
just....following procedure, sir. they're entitled to burial.
willie, shut up.  yo' old ass need to get in a little bit o' trouble sometimes.
thanks.
that's a fact. what you do, boy?
did you ask walter to get you a shrink?  barry, did you ask walter to get you a shrink? what's wrong with you? are you ok?
yes. i would swear my love to you.
his wife.
yes.
am i supposed to not be freaked out right now? because i am.
i have a message for you; i love you.  may i dedicate the next number to you?...and the next, and the next. every sunday i'll buy you a new bonnet -
i don't understand the song. tell me plain how they did it.
we are.  your camera.
show me in case you get zapped as soon as we land.
ho's a good guy --
mary janes, mom.  you promised.
they tried to electrocute me, frank.
if we married, we'd shut him out forever.
ever seen one?
you don't find me cute? come on, look at these muscles.
i'm not sick.
no, that was the most fun i've ever had without laughing.
when was the last time you heard me sneeze?
yes, thomas. i have always been here. i have always worked in the garden.
he talked to me today. told me to keep my mouth shut or i'd get everybody in trouble.
okay.
because we aren't ready yet for the french. before attacking, we must have safe places from which to depart and find refuge. of course, there is the casbah. but even the casbah isn't safe yet. there are too many drunks, pushers, whores, addicts, spies ... people who talk too much ... people who are ready to sell themselves, undecided people. we must either convince them or eliminate them. we must think of ourselves first. we must clean out the casbah first. only then will we be able to deal with the french. do you understand, ali?
she didn't say.
what was the matter with it?
heavy third world connections. they get weapons, drugs, fuel, choppers - everything is pumped into the island from the south.
i have a proposition for whoever has those letters. i will handle the entire transaction, get rid of the letters, take all the risk, for a small percentage.
michael, take it easy.
stolen memories. stolen and hazy. they taunt me in my dreams. i've seen a beautiful woman lying back and beckoning for me to love her. whose woman was this? i've seen boys playing, splashing about in a stream. whose childhood friends were these?  who am i?
jeff -- if anybody walked in here, i don't think they'd believe what they see.
and you believed him when he told you he had done that.
i don't know. it just feels good. always did.
when we're done, erase this friggin' tape.
now it's my job to look out for you. you're like a kid sister to me. do i look like some kind of gossip queen?
death, i'm trying to make things right. take my soul. turn me into a paper doll. but give me just one lousy hour.
what happened? how far did you get?
but i see, she didn't mean old in years. you always carry an umbrella, bruce?
oh, stop that --  damn! be careful, there --
i've fallen in love with somebody else, lila.
what?
so that gives you something.
really?  you know, seeing these guys away from the court, the facade slips. you catch things.
come on. let me buy you something to eat. looks like you could use the company.
yes.
and once i'm a woman, jean-claude and i are getting married --
as well as can be expected, i guess. give me the bad news.
she didn't notice.
you and leland and mr. kane - you were great friends back in the old days, i understand.
don't even say it, man.
the party?
no we can't. that's the problem. god knows it would beat hanging around with you!
--almost a year before he left the justice department--
... to target at ban kia na.  we probe the site...
we're going for the stronghold.
of course not! i'm a wanderer!  i'd like to go somewhere i've never been!
you're too young.  sorry.
believe me, i wouldn't be doing this unless it was absolutely necessary. i have an idea for something.
unwell?
she's your nothin'...she's no kin to you at all!
you know my back.
but you're sure we've met, huh?
what are you thinking? are you angry with me?
what octopus motor?
okay. let's go shopping.
i'm crash override.
what if--
i don't know what else. you've been that route a little, haven't you?
0150.
where are you going, sebastian?
hello!  good morning.
it must be the chemical fumes in the studio. people start imagining things --
the ear is from a missing person maybe?
yep.
snoop, if you don't know where glenn is...
i've got a gig tonight.
yeah, a little runoff. where are those orchards?
what if they do question the authenticity?
do you want the car?
how much longer for the range and power projections?
like i wanted to talk to you. i didn't need any more reason to do it. who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist?
everybody's life's got static. is your life perfect?
what?  who the hell are they?
i know - here i am always a brown man, there you would be always a white woman.
beautiful.
like a marriage made in heaven?
i'm glad you've come to talk with me, doolittle. it's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me.
yes.
hey, you have to see my new good luck charm.
...so it blows up that big... what they call an omelette surprise!
maybe... but you're the one whose ass is dragging.
he loved her.
i don't know. there's some tension between us. i'd hate to expose you to that.
well, i'm a college graduate --
we don't chat.
smashing!
yes, vada i think you're very pretty. you've got these great big sparkling eyes, the cutest little nose, an amazing mouth.
not on the map.  looks like it connects with the city sewer.
effective. but to tell you the truth, i've lost my passion for work.
you tell me again.
it's not a plan. it's just --
[cutting in] mackenzie, listen to me. listen. i'm going to die.
what kind of opinions?
will you stay here for the night? you can leave in the morning. that's when my parents get back and --
no.
let's go outside and talk.
it's alright, barton. you don't have to write actual scenes?
the incident of the other night is a nuisance that i can take care of. i came to you because i want nothing to affect our agreement; i wanted to clear everything i'm going to do with you, just in case.
not a dent.  perfect
you doin' here, doug, thought you started out the day with that pernicious <u>caffeine</u>...
where is he? where's the bastard that runs this shit hole?
yes.
what?
go breaker.
no!
i want blood
excellent! excellent! my boy, i'm convinced our state has a great debt of gratitude to you--
beginner's luck.
pop the trunk, tumbler.
in return you'll receive minuets, days, weeks, i'm not going to go into details ... what matters is that i stay interested.
then stop acting like one. if you're really in some kind of trouble, i'd like to hear about it. otherwise, it's late, i'm tired and i'm going home to bed.
good luck, austin.
hey there's your dad and shelly.
what about you, everett? what'd you have in mind when you stoled it in the first place?
yes, i am aware. how has your time in china been?
when we do: no mumbo-jumbo. double- core vulcan-65 grenades.
no.
you talked to his wife?
i don't know.
morning, radar. how were things?
alex and charlie?  simple.  alex is the smarter one.
sal, get 'em in the vault.
you did, didn't you?
two detectives are coming out.
honesty is always best.
two steps back, please.
don't annoy me, travis.
i look good tonight. and i feel lucky, too.
that's right.  i <u>am</u> your doctor.
about 5,000 troops.
who the fuck is it to you?
please don't go.
what happened to jim?
yeah.  al wants to talk to you!
too late.  just my luck.
but, why must you confront him?
when this whole thing started you made it clear: you're running the show.  and i don't believe you'd be running this show if you didn't know what was going on.
like old times. same booth, same song --
please don't talk like that. you're upset. i'm not helping you. i'm sorry for what i did. i better go.
simon.
cramps.
show us where you are, chief.
do you think i consider this recreation?
dear miss laury...i take pen in hand to let you know ethan and me still are trying to catch up with them com- anches the late mister futterman told us about...
count leon d'algout... a count!... a nobleman!
i know. simultaneously, they shake and zip. claude bends down and picks up a bowl of gumbo, placing it on a tray next to an identical one.
how about capturing the kitchen and barricading the door?
a bruised lip.
‘that which does not kill me makes me stronger.’
do you want me to take his leg off? where's the fourth?
how's the pain?
how's my pregnant chick!
what the hell are these?
christ.  i didn't lock the fucking drawer!  you spend twenty years thinking some perp's gonna whack you... you'll crash your car... but what happens is, you fuck yourself...  you can't imagine how many times i saw you two... your head together, i wish him dead.  every time... want to hear something weird?  i feel like i'd give my life to bring him back.
we need you here. i can bring her in.
i called mommy.
aren't you gonna go introduce yourself?
i'm sorry, sir.  a year ago there was a fire in the old hotel paraiso. this is the new hotel paraiso.
oh.  who's in it?  i know what it is.  it's what's on instead of the movie.
if there are other photographs... i think i may know how to find them.
i don't have a problem with it.
what about you, you got a crew already?
sure, valiant, sure...
this is private property.  this is breaking and entering!
i don't know. senior editor? sounds like you're in to me.
i know.  i know.  i've seen a lot of kids die, too, in world war ii.
i was about to ask you the same thing, going out with a college boy and all.
i want it.
tons
you need to know a lot of shit, vincent.
i'll be back before you leave.
i found sand. i saw death.
it just ain't happening --
yeah. and?
so you could sleep! i mean christ!
how come we didn't just drop near the camp... save this hassle?
i'm through with puppets, lotte. i just want you to know that.
i don't know, ang'. wadda you feel like doing?
i cannot proceed without examining the previous victims.
well, i can't let you down now, can i?
well, say, how 'bout easin' it down a bit so a man don't have to shout!
oh, shit!
i don't have the strength to fight off la mamma... anyway who wants to spend their whole life waiting at the end of a pier.
what?
i've never sent a letter like that, you know?  i mean, i felt like i wanted to tell you something, but i didn't put it in the letter, and i didn't say it, but i want to say it now, i'm not sure if i should say it, you know, 'cause people always say it and don't mean it, but i think that i mean it, so, um, i just wanted to tell you...
visual --
if a young woman, a stenographer, -- etc.
boys, we're home free.
yes, i do.
i don't know about you, guys, but i'm getting a little buzz off this.
int. brynner's van - night.
krieger.
seems like i hear everything that goes on in this dump. pipes or somethin'. i'm just glad i don't have to ply my trade in the wee-wee hours.
can anyone hear what we say?
mr. hardy, i joined the army for college money. i didn't ask for any of this -- i tried to do the right thing out there and people got killed. you say finding those bodies'll help me, then go find them. i don't want to die.
we don't have the time to bring someone new up to speed. besides...  you've already impressed everyone you need to, haven't you?
why?
yeah... that was a good scene. i mean, for a horror movie.
come on, just a little somethin'. right here. go'on now, don't be shy.
the new vehicle, plus forty thousand dollars.
why don't i set you down here and we won't argue about it.
- to her cooking.
no, no. i want to go in.
that's the boardwalk, sam.
just to keep me company, sam -- i hate smoking alone.  how about you?  i thought all you ira types smoked.
you know what i want you to do? get a couple of guys to dig a hole in the desert, then let 'em show you where it's at.
mick.  mick.  mick...
i have to.
to place it inside its coffin.
you'll know very soon. i'm starting the last chapter. and when i finish, i want everything to be perfect. i'll require three things.
really.
i don't know - it's your house ellen
there's no replacement 'cause of your boss' cuts, if that's what you mean. if someone else goes out on an injury we're really screwed.
in matters concerning the household, i act on her behalf.
nonsense. we didn't steal it. there's no law against stealing stolen money.
this is not an appropriate time for a conversation.
but i thought you didn't want to go trick-or-treating.
but there's no more drug.
nothing can't wait. shall we check it out with the major?
a castle's but stone and mortar --
i can't believe you're reacting this way. you're just saying this because you lost the bet.
they told me they don't help out stalkers.  look, maybe they're right, it's been a long time.
i do bite my thumb, sir!
then maybe you should get your glasses checked.
but he didn't ask me.
what is it... the secret?
what two?
do you remember when we met at the bar? ...you were wearing a tuxedo.
it's okay.  edward told me.  your secret's safe with me.
normally, i would agree. but in this case, the mission requires a certain knowledge of 21st century history. you're many things, number one, but you're not much of an historian.
it's different now. help me.
do you like porno movies?
every young boy's fancy. i seem to remember it myself.  very well. mr. scott, are your engines capable of handling a minor training cruise?
anything goes wrong, head for your homes, just sit tight -- you'll hear from me or howard.
goodbye, darling.
are you finished?
johnny...
i know -- i know.
you'd do the same for me, wouldn't you, doc?  if i was caught, wouldn't you?
i - i don't know, bill. just a feeling, i don't know...
what do i care about your mother- in-law! you're still working for this paper, aren't you! or are you?
no, it's fine. [beat, swallow] thanks.
oh, please.
i haven't any money but i'll get a job and --
you sure run a tight-assed ship 'round here, don't ya!
you think my play is bad?
why?
well, i got to see her.
keep your voice down.
oh, for god's sake, phyllis -- we have no reason to doubt the man! are we listening to lionel now?
....why does he do it...?
bullshit.  you told me i'd get half a million dollars.  you told me i'd be set.
yeah, dickhead.
nah.
what's in the other direction?
how extravagant you are, throwing away women like that. someday they may be scarce.
it's sim.  we're almost there.
ready.
thanks.
he's part of the mix. sid 6.7 is a composite.
i love going to movies, especially at the drive in. i don't think there's anything more romantic than going to the drive in.  i'll let you get back to work.
oh?
but it's the horror movies you'll be remembered for.
what is this shit you're talking all of a sudden?  you're a bus driver, "homes," you live in flatbush, so please don't start spouting some elmore leonard shit you just heard because i saw that movie too,
would you like to have a drink with me? i just finished a game, i could use a beer.  i don't pick up people in drug stores every day.
is that a trick question? c'mon, i can't be the only one who thinks this is cool.
actually we have something for you.
no... i want to be confessed.
maybe we should sit.
yeah, live on my salary - that is, until i finish writing my play.
all right.  i'll have to look for it.
mention my family once more and you're dead.
you should have gone to the funeral.
do it!
yeah, we met. they're good men.
i promise. is that all?
ah -- i see.  no, i'm afraid mine are the o'higgins of watertown.
he couldn't have.
i'm here for the same reason you are, so let's do it.
you're ruining us.  if we stay with you, you'll take us down with you.  this isn't political, dick.  this is our life.
information.
—ex-tanker who's walking on his heels— ?
well, i don't know. i gave the man his money, sent him on his way.
i don't know.
ten bucks.
got a handkerchief?
i'll explain it to you. do you remember lil's dance?
what?
hold it!
i don't think so.
that i gotta see.
what are they about?
so lie down.
i just need a few more weeks,
why you in such a hurry to get to shooting?
i work, just like you. you're more of a crook than i am, dude.
george, he wasn't asking.
you know me?
the sera monks have surrendered?
like where'd you work before brown & williamson?
yeah. you're a mystery. i like you. very much.
oh, my holy stars! a negro!
he sounds like a person worth while knowing.
sure.
sounds like a good idea.
but, general, we're on our toes.  we haven't agreed to anything for years.  inffact, a a lot of people say we never will.
damn it, mom. i told you i need them all!
ken, it's bruce. listen, we've got a nibble on the pendleton financing.
you live a phony cheap cop-out existence.
you like her.
a float!
it's been a long time.
that's why the key didn't work, they changed the locks.
you going to let him? you going to reward him by being the son he was never man enough to be a father to?
roy, i don't want money from you.
why not?
yes he is - he wants to talk to you.
i'm sorry. no.
hey, i spent all my money on those caramels.
find you?
i've got photographs of you at the trenton ramada looking very--
who didn't? she could play basketball like jerry west, she danced like sid cherice, then she'd look at you with those big blue eyes, forget about it. i asked her out a couple of times but she always said no.
uh ... yeah, well, you know, ma, john kennedy went by jack.
you still got the touch junior.
i don't know.  i'm working on it.  i was on the wrong track.
the bet's off.
just send me a money order.
that's the way it's done.
you're all hear.
what night?
high speed train.  no-one gets on.  no- one gets off.  high security.  good place for a pass off to max.
so what did you want? i think we understand each other, no?
i ain't never going back to that school, sir.
armed.
you know.
not exactly.
hey -- you believe what you want. shu kai kim is innocent.
i was about to throw in the towel.
well, what else does?
yes?
but i've got to tell you, if mergers are in the wild, i've got some great prospects i've developed.  i want to talk to you about them next week.
and reynolds?
i'm just saying, the man is a problem.  and he's your problem. wasn't me idea to bring him along.
colonel. pleasure.
am i supposed to say 'thank you'?
what the hell are you talkin' about? call her.
impossible!
look, the other night, i want to apologize.
how many sharks have you killed?
-- make the left -- toward the bridge --
i'm not that fond of blondes -- maybe i like brunettes --
i'd rather sit. are you ready?
just for the criminals.
no, haven't heard of it.
about what?
right.  so, you have a new place, you've started working a bit -- i'm sure you'll be meeting some new people.
what? to put one of these in my pocket?
you heard me, jesse. you know how crazy i get!
i'm not hungry.
you can't, convict!  you're just a shmoe!  every shmoe has the fantasy the planet revolves around them.  it rains, car crash stops traffic, you say "how could this happen to me?"  it's a natural inclination.  but for i, this isn't a fantasy, it is <u>reality</u>! you are on my planet!  you walk around the corner for coffee, out of my sight, you do not fucking exist!  the lives of shmoes like you have meaning only in relation to the rich, to the powerful, to me!
you're hurtin', man!
ahh!  eat it, dalton!
let's hope i can say the same about you one day.
i've got the boy on the phone.  he's using a cell phone.  what was that, son?  i didn't hear you.
blow me.  yellow means go, kimmy.
don't they, though?
right, of course, the company... but you see, i've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
you bit my finger.
who's fault is it then if it's not yours? you're the one in charge, daddy.
sara, this is doctor sheppard.  i called you earlier about a book.
they aren't exactly gonna publicize this,  arlo. 
daddy?
yes ma'am. i like a fried chicken leg.
well, i wish you'd stop criticizing and picking on her.
son, have a look in his locker.
kiss me you semitic stud!
aren't we going a little hard?
are you one of the players?
well if you're bailing, i guess i'd better give you your surprise now.
epps!
would that be miss sinclair?
he went to rent a movie, but he hasn't gotten back yet. ah, screw it; i'll just lock the store up and leave him a note.
i'm wearing a t-shirt and panties.
don't cry, mollie, there's nothing to cry about.
no, there doesn't. not really -- just so many want it to exist... so many who don't want to die... want it so much that a place called sanctuary becomes "real". but it doesn't exist. it never existed. just the hope.
this is incredible. i was just sitting here trying to figure out how to contact you. i mean, you don't have an answering service, right?
if i thought you were the slightest bit interested, i would.
if only we hadn't made this journey. if only the car hadn't broken down. if only we were amongst friends or sane persons.
big ed’s.
that's rache's song!
i admit he is very clever. three times he slipped through our fingers. in paris he continued his activities. we intend not to let it happen again.
it's okay.  she scrambled the transmission.  luther, continue feeding the gps her position.
yes, sir.
and i'd take it out on him.
the disc is still in there.
we're takin' you to a cabin in the woods, it's only a couple miles from my house.  keep off the highways, they'll be lookin' for us.
that was my companion. she sings little peasant songs quite nicely -- a completely untrained voice, of course.
i know he does.
is she saying this in albanian...?
then? you didn't give a shit about her father, didn't you?  you met anyway?
this isn't our goddamn game!
yeah - and get us into a million dollar libel suit. it wouldn't be the first time. now, you get over there and get a statement out of the old lady, the sister, or the kid. any of them - but get it.
hah!  yeah, oz, i bet it's more like your dad works at <u>her</u> store.
you have our cards.
shhh.
not just a baby, porthos.  i carried the child of the king.
sir, this candidate believes he'll make a good officer, sir!
switch! you drive!
i keep hearing you helped a lot of jews to escape. how did you do that?
we'll figure something out.
don't ask what you can do. no coddling. life rolls on status quo.
excuse me?
i have a temporary sequence on the monitor --
stay up here and finish your interview, i've got to see what the hell's going on down there before i can take responsibility for you to film there.
andy! no!
archibald dobbs; certified public accountant.  but, that's all we got.
well you weren't around this time so i did the whole thing myself.
this is kronos one. i am chancellor gorkon.
i know who you are -- your cruelty reveals everything.
hey...
some bone fragments came up in the sift this morning. we thought there'd been another fatality, but we found out fema had recovered them from an archeological site out of town.
this is horseshit. it coulda been so easy.
do you wanna give me a minute?
i don't getcha.
i'm sorry. it's these goddamned shoes. i don't know how anyone actually walks in these things.
don't be silly.
how about over there...that empty memory?
i don't know... but it does.
--we had the gun on him tonight-- the last five pitches he threw were faster than the first five. 96 miles an hour, 98, 97, 97. 97.   he's got the best young arm i've seen in 30 years.
you'll see!
why?
hey, amber, y'get my smokes?
chingachgook's of the same opinion. taken together, that's gospel. your fort will stand or fall depending on webb and reinforcements, not these colonials' presence.
you look great, castor. really.  here -- i got a shot of your favorite -- mescal.  even has the worm.
but it's true!  you can call him yourself.
this is a one-way argument.  we've got six days; if you go and we fight and we hate it -- we'll come home.  if you don't go?  well, that's a much bigger deal.  i go to london right after that. so, it'd be very big deal if you stay here.  the plane's boarding.  you're good at deadline.  here's your ticket.
they've got the real thing outside.
it crashed, didn't it?
ma's told me about it a thousand times.
there's only one way.
i think you're right, it would be harder on her. but you'd better call mr. hillyer, she's going to need help to get home.
nine.
susan's patient is whom we are talking about.
i said, are you deaf as well as stupid?
okay, mr. book.
okay?
i can't understand that fancy talk.  you mean i'm a gold-digger? sure, i'm a gold-digger -- why not?
praetor shinzon, i'm pleased to...
she od'd, didn't she?
change my name.
a rosary for mama, a dress for
i'm sure. it's her husband. he's her campaign manager.
you know, i've been to three shrinks and a hypnotist. nothing penetrates that night. nothing.
no sir.
any friends?
look, jeff -- we had two wonderful months this summer -- and that was it. happens all the time -- the wife and kids go away to the country, and the boss has a fling with the secretary or the manicurist -- or the elevator girl. comes september, the picnic is over -- goodbye. the kids go back to school, the boss goes back to the wife, and the girl --  they don't make these shrimp like they used to.
it's nothing.
i beg your pardon, i'm not an asshole.  i'm an actor.
great carolyn, doing any better would be a sin...
... just a perception.
it must be something.
epps.  what if they're not saudi.
charles, what time is it?
have you got a warrant?  get the hell out o here!  this is the <u>only space i have left in the</u> <u>world</u>!  why can't you leave me out of it?
is this all the food i get?
that won't be necessary.  sooner or later i knew you'd crack this thing, max.  you got me.
well, ted, to tell you the truth, i found out through the grapevine that it might be, and i only said might be, the drexl spivey that was responsible for that restaurant break-in on riverdale.
nowhere....
i think you're the liar.
giovanino!  where have you been?
what is?
he won't.
auxiliary field at haleiwa, ten miles north of here.
poor laurie. you scared another one away.
donna, you are a muffin.
our mission is coffee, tom. a shot of the bull, puerto rican espresso.
when did you make this, walter?
what... what are you talking about?
yah, thanks, stan, it's a pretty -
and i don't just mean the sec. we could have the fbi breathing down our necks.
good, good.  glad to hear it.
one-hundred-thousand!?  that son-of- a-bitch lied to me.
let's try down here...
i mean it.  from what i can tell, we’re a mom and pop operation, we’re already over-extended in sales, and any price advantage we could offer would easily be matched by a larger supplier...
i agree.  but i also think certain young and naive people need to thank their lucky stars and be very, very grateful the whole school didn't find out about certain indiscretions which could have ruined their reputations, and chances to win certain elections.
i'm gonna clean it up.
acceleration is no longer a constant.
new york is dangerous place.
i'm mary 2.
hi.  this is heather langenkamp.
i think that is its hand.
peter ...
really.  i thought maybe that was his snowmobile outside.  by the way -- your truck also 'on the fritz?'
my dear, sweet, baby sister, i'll have you know, that at this moment my career is on a high note.
dad--if my curveball is hanging, god ain't gonna help me.
no.
gavin? gavin elster? you'd think i'd would. no.
that's disgustin'. those kinda sentiments shouldn't be allowed out in public. is this biloxi yet?
i'd been told as much.
oh, no, i'm fine...fine.
my mind fills with so many images.
i'm sorry, general, if i...spoke out of turn. it's just that...mr tyler is not here to defend himself. he has no representation. i don't believe due process is being served by...
ain't gonna work this time, buddy. look how small that fuse is! i'll get killed.
a few indiscretions in his youth.
how long you here, joe?
why not?
sean!  catch it!
i know.    you are my son -
oh i was walkin' down lime street one day...
why?
everybody!  back here!
course he ain't never killed nobody. why'd you say that, pace?
it is an emergency, isn't it?
thank you for understanding, mama.
yes. i'm now in charge of the paralegal department.
mmm.
the stiff one eye?
a what?
i said another man was buried in his place.
it could blow over tomorrow, too.
listen to me:  we're getting you out.
you've got it all figured.
not chopped up.  not chopped up like that.  i mean, what do i got left? coupla articles.  a medal or two. plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore.
i kind of had to improvise.  sorry about your guitar.
you, my friend, are dead.  i saw your body.  you got buried.
five minutes...
how's today then?
calm down.  look, i didn't want to tell you this, but we've had some problems with our protection program lately.
no.
you know, i-i think... if i could pry this door off... we shoulda gotten steaks 'cause they don't have legs. they don't run around.
we know, but our man says no way on the dope. this hungarian tells me the whole bunch was pulling stumps for turkey the next' day. they had no time to negotiate that kind of product and no means to move it.
... i'm listening.
bzzzzzzzzzt!
praetor shinzon. we’re not here to discuss your lack of a social life.
holed up. huh huh huh. holed.
what about marla?
perhaps.  but the idea of willingly going to <u>school</u> to spend my <u>life</u> at a paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder-lizards - i'm referring to war - <u>that</u> strikes me as the <u>worst</u> cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow!
that's illegal.  you want us pulled over?  i'll turn around at the corner if you'll shut the fuck up.
two years married, divorced, used to be a lawyer, quit, i'm still waiting on his sperm count.
let's just say you're being closely watched, george. your other option is to get your porn off the rack and treat kayleigh like... oh, let's say like how a loving father treats his daughter. sound okay to you, papa?
monica, what did you do?
ah. well. ah,  i see you've got your manager with you. well, madame, how about half the receipts?
naw naw!
"paranoia, insecurity, depression, changes in vision, feelings of losing control; belief that you have a mental problem..." nothing about turning into a werewolf.
great idea.  let me get some shoes. i'll take you home.
i've been a little dyspeptic.
sin city. devil's playground. the black bitch. all day every day.  where's tina?
say you shortchanged me and you shortchanged yourself.
i'm talking about a girl you want to fuck, so give me a break.
keaton always said: &quot;i don't believe in god, but i'm afraid of him.&quot; well i believe in god, and the only thing that scares me is keyser soze.
nothing.
sir.
could we make it to the mountains?
i'm not sure how to take that.
they're just words.
good.  that's very good.
really? i'd like to find out.
the mountains?
i love you, norm.
good night.
no problem with me on the job.
not exactly the kind of thing a secret service agent can throw himself on top of.
hmmm... figuring out what kind of music i like and then finding me a rare album. you're not trying to soften me up, are you?
i got it. you're talking about your dog. i thought that was the name of the colored man i've been seeing in the hall.
what is it?
yep, it sure is.
i guess he figured it was better.
he said... take his right arm.
he still might be around.  i saw fresh tire tracks coming in.
i love you, honey.
what is it?
maybe she doesn't need any.  should we check?
it means nothing.
-- i'm on it --
all right, let's go.
whatever you're getting paid, i can give you twenty, maybe thirty bucks more.
i love you, too.
let's hope we are not the hors d'oeuvres.
...are you going to trade all night again? you got to go to work in a couple of hours.
no you're not.
they were both poisoned. i spent the last few years building up an immunity to iocane powder.
cost what?
how are you? sorry. is your book going well?
it's that mrs. goodhall you have to be careful of, wilbur.
and if it should change?
i was practicing. i've got an audition next week -- i gotta practice. how am i gonna get famous if i don't practice?
so now you've got to talk him out of it. and then we've got to figure out an acceptable political solution.
i want to know exactly who you are and what you're really up to!
you mean, i have to viddy two sessions in one day?
krieger can get it.  right?
i think you better sit down.
what are you talking about, gilbert? you weren't there!
huh? huh huh.
what's with the banquet? this is supposed to be a private meet.
uh-huh - in what way?
keep it.
you can't kill a president.
i don't understand.  track 2's chile?
what are you going to do? shoot him?
...i better not...
you don't have to tell me anything.
congratulations.  welcome to the club.
where was your father born?
gale...
i've not heard a note out of you.
my name's sondra.
um ... yes i do. where's our lawyer?
the word from murray is: leave them alone.  if we need a new signature he'll go out himself, he'll be the president, just come in, from out of town...
she doesn't know, mrs. kane.  she just sent it - because i made her see it wouldn't be smart for her not to send it.
he was a teacher , kind of a know it all... always had this little smile.
yeah, from boston.
...they are the tears of old russia... see that stone?
my bodyguard. he follows me everywhere. he’s decisive, vigilant.  and he makes an excellent omelette.
this is a travesty.  a debacle.
for a guy who was lucky to be water-boy on the high school team, you sure got a big mouth, kent.
his medical condition is reported as... &quot;terminal.&quot;
we have tapes in here that go back six months. let me show you something.
for god sakes, owen, listen to me -- he knew about the boy in fresno and he says three billion people are going to die!
it is a nice piece of writing.
got another twenty years in it, boy.  by the way, son, do you recall rose, that pretty blonde girl who came to our house way back in 1935 or 1936 and caused such a damnable commotion.
this is important to me.
the oath. you didn't say--
alright, ms. connor.  listen carefully.  you're in a public place, you'll be safe 'til we get there.  stay visible. don't go outside or in the restroom.  i'll be there in a few minutes.
can i show you something?
um, i understand that this science friction is popular -- but don't the big hits always have big stars?
if you came back.
you know, people.
get on the other side of that.
screw me?  that can't be right.
we don't have a choice.
no...
yes.  the thing is... i have to go away today but i wondered, if i didn't, whether you might let me see you a bit... or, a lot maybe... see if you could... like me again.
dynamite --
no, i didn't. i wanted to humiliate him. for what he did to dunbar. for fucking over the little guy.
i get ah - -
i don't expect you to.
i'm doing it.
up in the air?  was <u>that</u> your reaction?
makes me want to hold on and never let go.
no idea.  we have no surface support. it transmitted too fast to be coming from underwater.
i figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect.  and piss you off.
honey - - i would know any randomly selected square inch of vicki vale.  if i had a good enough hint.
shall we have another?
you don't like miss lawson much do you?
they left me stranded.  twice. what have you got to lose?
why, yes, of course.
i don't like him.
i sleep like a dead horse. anything else?
so?
would you do us the honor of joining us? we're just sitting down at mess.  pork chops and gravy, cranberries, baked potatoes with all the trimmings, fresh- baked bread, apple pie...
they wouldn't do it in front of all these people.  they'd send someone later, when we're alone.
close. we're so hush-hush, even we know nothing about it.  now let's see, there's coconut cake, date and walnut; i recommend the rum baba ...
oh...
i suppose i can't call this off without creating a scene -- but remember, it's your last fling.
i see. well, i'm sorry about that. i wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.
she's one of those.  your mother would not want you consorting with her kind.
yours will do!
'cause this is the cove he obviously lives in.
no, she wasn't my sister.
there are different circuits... it's hard to explain... you wouldn't understand...
so the method of death is the only connection?
i... i don't know, air.  this guy. mr. "best of the best of the best... " i don't know.  it's just still find it a little...  humorous.  i'm sorry.  sir.
i don't have a week.  this case never should have come to trial. you know better.  you're mr. independent.  you want to be independent?  be independent now. i've got no sympathy for you.
i'm taking a remedial high school art class for fuck-ups and retards.
no, i'm awake. what's the matter?
waitin' in the lounge.
a weirdo making s+m films?  who'd have thought it?
yes, you. we're looking for our room... 1002.
tell that to jack vincennes.  to stensland.
the young lady staying in your room?
no, jabez -- all i need is some rest -- you go and pay our debt. everything'll be all right then ... everything.
what about the other boys--do you think they'll go to the police?
my friend is looking for her brother and she thinks this woman knows where he is.  can you tell us what she's saying?
your wife and children are back in new hampshire in the snow?
say again?  all after incinerators?
what's this?
that's what i asked you, ain't it?
this is what he was doin'.
what job?
what plan?
you're fine like that, mom.
we've got ten triacs before we're toast!!
from back in houston. we both come up on fifth street.
we can't make it.
thank you so much. merci. it's very wonderful to hear a man say such a nice compliment.
i will. can my assistant come, too?
thanks. it does, the more you know who you are... you don't care about things the same way...
what, you want to come in here and save me? is that what you want to do? do i have a sign that says "save me" on my back?
england.  only, we saw there was a show on, thought i might pick something up for a price, type of thing.
since as long as we've been keeping records...
sure.
i did. he said he had work to do until late.
is that a poem?
sweetheart, it was over a year ago.
don't you start it, too!
i'm supposing.
no.
hey, the bastard's got my gun.  i want it back.
george bailey.
well?...
i don't want to be responsible for his food. just a small green salad. and a perrier.
dorothy fowler. fantastic woman. she passed last year in a train wreck. damned amtrak.
i dunno.  might be a glitch.
why do you come to me?  why don't you go to a travel agent?
good evening mr. torrance.
what do you want?
which way do you mean?
i saw the sign.
yeah, check out teldar paper, it's still not over.
all right then.
looks like it.
no, a <u>pact</u>.  no money involved.  this is more important than any bet.  now here's the deal: we all get laid before we graduate.
what d'you mean?
you usually get two.
tell you the truth, i don't give a shit for me. but that little girl is so special, and you're gonna fuck her up.
why?
not for money. with my mother.
they only cover one fifty in incidentals. you've been ordering fucking... motherfucker...
the computer's translated the alien signal, and it's kind of alarming.
you mean we should go after her!...
motherfucker works fast.
you!
i know.
well...
sorry.
rath.  robert rath.
hiya, jesus.
where is she?
so... bring up the reinforcements!
yeah, for the last time, i hope. i'm done with this freak show. i'm moving back to the real world.
no, i mean, no one.
cash poor?
skeleton key. this opens the gates of babylon.
okay ...
no one else in here?
no. he knows no one in london, besides me. i shouldn't have left him alone.
early didn't kill nobody, he wouldn't do that. i don't know why you're saying those things. you ain't my friend.
the left, i think.  those surgeons in witness protection can fix things nobody's even broken yet.
i can predict the next words you're gonna say: "anyone but bernstein."  i want to send a reporter to miami.
be careful, francie.
one of the other sisters?
i wanted to bring you some flowers. they're pretty good ones.
he's not spending the entire summer with another kid in tahoe.  if he leaves, i will follow him up there and i will drag him home by his nose ring.  he can hate me.  you can hate me.  he can try to kill me while i sleep.  you can call the police.  you can call your husband or your attorney, but sam is spending the summer with me.  he's my son.  he's sixteen.  that's it.
logan cale.
it's important.
no, immediately. the people are demoralized. leave this to me ...
okay.  yeah.  we know
okay. good tits. can't we show them off a little more?
she sits down.
you people really don't like dogs.
only were he a fool to boot.  see yon viper?
are you happy?
loomis, it's over. leave it alone.
anyone else residing there?
and where did he go to school?
<u>computer off</u>!
okay?
what's that?
and to think what coulda happened in that king-sized bed tonight...
it's not in the river, is it harry?
you can tell something about him or we wouldn't have found the finger print...
who is he?
i really only brought you here to show you my pigeons!
how the hell do you know?
you want me to come out there and play private eye?
that is bullshit! mine is a bitch and yours is a psycho. i can't believe you're saying this, marylin! there's nothing wrong with us. we're attractive and charismatic and successful and... i like us.
obviously.
personally, they are of no interest to me, i'd rather sell weapons..but i have a customer... so tell me...
they always let felons sit in on honors biology?
a tale more horrible than all the rest combined!
you sure you'll be okay?
i'm busy, duffy.
so you'll come to the wedding, right?
everyone back.
oh, yes, that's right.
if it's too far, then we'll drown. but if we don’t try then we'll never know.
i got contacts. listen tom, if you pointed them at me i'd shit myself or do whatever you said to do. either way you still get the desired effect.
well the same things you do.  hang out with friends and stuff, you know, whatever.  what do you think i do?
say!  do any of you guys know the madison?
to me, it shows part of our history in this country, a time when we were considered inferior, sub-human.
they ain't the only ones.
third time around.
...what do you want me to do, punch him out?  i have to work with him...
is that a boat?
great!
i don't, really.  i was referred to him.
i know you are.  go you huskies.
i don't buy or sell human beings.
i think he owes more to you.  but that's not important now.  i know what's going on between you two.
<u>no</u>.  if you don't kill him instantly, i'm dead and you'll only kill him instantly if you get his brain, which is about the size of a cherry.  and even if you <u>were</u> on target, a bullet might not penetrate his hide.
we're not in the showroom, dear.
i'm an orthopedic surgeon, she's an orthopedic surgeon.
i found this chicago station before. wait a minute...  here it is.
i'm not going out anymore. i'm not getting hurt again. this was the last time. i told you.
i don't know.  i'm guessing.
ginger.
then something goes wrong.  meeks gets killed.  maybe stens got greedy, killed meeks and left him under his girlfriend's house.  the night he died, stens was all mysterious.  said he had something big going down.
mulet.
i'll be there.  the danburrys.  friday night.  thank you, chris.
okay?
you've come to rescue me?
d'you think you and charley'll ever get back together again?
more bullshit!  more bullshit!  what kind of odds are they giving me?  there must be some kind of office pool.  one month?  a couple of days?
no --
i brought the girl.  she's outside.
enough, macready!
news, last night... those guys, the ex-presidents... they robbed my bank yesterday.  and i was just there the day before, cashing a check.  see... look.  assured trust... same place.
anything at all?
i'll be fine.
good fact.  well, you let me know.
last year? it can't be that long.
toilet clogged.  short fat turd.  let's get out of here.
no, buddy, i'm the one he wants.
forget it.
you are 'sp fucking' wrong.
come on now.  people are smart.
whether i liked him or not is irrelevant.  it's business. there's no emotion involved in business... if you want to survive.
huh?
i just wanted to test it first.
the man downstairs said number--
...and one helluva guy.
it's all clear to me now -- so clear.
yes. sing some more.
thank you.  goodnight.
jesus fucking christ.
daniel's life is already ruined. maybe if you guys stopped thinking about yourselves for a change and--
is that why you were wandering around at one o'clock in the morning?
i wanted to.
it's not much different from enterprise.  when i was a guest aboard her some years ago, captain kirk kindly allowed me to memorize her technical manuals. and now, mr. chekov, let us review: you say you have no details of project 'genesis' ?
gary blinker...
absolutely.  when i come back, maybe the two of us should spend some time together, on our own.  what do you think?
i think it's funny.
you just said he could eat anything.
well, that's the wrong line for a start.
the core...!
peter's right, captain.  he's got to be forced into making a mistake.
he'll do it.  you really-should have talked to him first.
i'd be glad to help.  for $50 an hour.
you got me beat on both accounts.
so what do i do?
paraffin.
maybe you just haven't met the right woman...
you saving me? you talking pretty tough for a guy got himself chained to the ceiling.
i'll think of something, don't worry.
i've been here since six o'clock this morning. why?
back when this started, was there anything unusual happening in your life? a change of job, of living situation... a loss of some kind?
oh please, harry... don't even think it. you're the only person who ever... it's just... can't you wait for me?
i would rather put my money on a three-legged rocking horse. the odds are a hundred to one for a good reason, bacon . . . it won't win. so where is ed with all the bright ideas?
i know. what do you think i felt when you said, "don't be soft?"
it was him.
i had another one of you guys down here from frisco -- about a year ago -- he asked me the same question.  what's this about anyway?
thanks.
dela, you should try it sometime. come into the light.
i don't know.
you've got a lot of nerve.
mother theresa.  gandhi.  don't you understand?  this is all a mistake.  i'm the good guy.  i'm the witness.  and i'm being punished!
monsieur laszlo, is it not?
there's another one i like, i read. it's by pope alexander.
i'll go.
yes.
what?
my head swells up like a watermelon and i drop dead.
not at all...
you don't have to be so touchy.
okay, i'll take a raincheck on that.
lower.
look look look look, when they build your business, then you can't fucking turn around, enslave them, treat them like children, fuck them up the ass, leave them to fend for themselves... no.  no.  you're absolutely right, and i want to tell you something.
oh god, he's coming over here, act natural, totally natural.
i'm a field agent -- last of an already extinct breed.  i do dark ops.
of course you don't know.
what are you saying?
i can't see them!
i wouldn't be a bit surprised.
i guess, the truth is i'm just not comfortable with the idle rich.  even when they try to act like heroes.
who on earth would want to harass poor dottie hinkle?
what?  now i'm working the drop car? who's handling the scene here?
no good. he needs guarantees. he says... his life is in danger... he has seen the devil... looked him in the eye.
he's coming to get me rachel.
come here.
the bathroom!  for two days?
but i don't want to go, i am enjoying it.
what the hell are you expecting him to drive to vanderbilt for?  milk and cookies?
i don't drink coffee...
sam, i'm going.
you think so?
no, it's weird, man. nobody knows where he went.
of course, please, this way. your servant may use the kitchen.
why don't we drive over to the cove and watch the sunset.  it'll mellow you out.
you had the mummy cancel all the others scheduled for this session.
why?  a man appears at your side, almost never leaves it, you clearly trust him, depend on him, i sense you value him deeply, why aren't those things good enough for me?
you won and was robbed! you didn't do nothin' wrong.
that was three years ago after that first party!
right.
uh -- i don't know.   sometimes it's just like a barter thing...  is this legal?
he also said crow was a fake.
well, she comes to see me. she was upset about a lot of things, especially that whole fuckin' diamond - that lester diamond incident.
who?
...omigod, no...
steady as she goes...
eddie did.
i'm putting it here by the door.
no, sir.
i don't, no matter what my sisters say, ok?
must be some strange power westley has over you women.  how do you expect to get there?
i told you. we met yesterday.
so...
where did this come from?
what?!?
i certainly did, sir...
now what can i do for you?
fine.
and they sure ain't from the neighborhood. figure sabu's in there?
sheriff? i'm doctor sam loomis.
i told you, i'm good at this.
say anything in there about karen sisco?
is your ship equipped with omega satellite navigation or loran?
definitely.
why didn't you stop at the market?
me?
my wife used to call me lenny.
she was randy's only girlfriend . . . ever.
it's like...
how do you know about that?
i love you.
really! that's wonderful.
he's so fine.
and clean.
when i'm dead--  or fucking.
all right, john, just take a breath, let's think about this...
hey, mickey -- whatta ya doin' here? here, sit down.
face it-the japanese will own most of this country by the end of the '90s.
gimme the binoculars.
your wife knows that, don't she?
for killing a man.
it worked in odessa...
he takes a cut of our earnings and invests it for us.  he makes us quit the life at thirty.  he doesn't let us use narcotics and he doesn't abuse us.  can your policeman's mentality grasp those contradictions?
is he on his own?
he's got to have a car, right? we just take him back to his car and tell him to get the fuck out of town before we kill him.
well, i don't know what else to say. it's a helluva party --
we're talking about psychology, doctor, not the bureau. can you decide for yourself whether or not i'm qualified?
on the contrary. we're married and we have no pre-nup, so a case could be made that everything in here is mine.
she's out with a friend.
okay, what is it? you want a ride?
are you watching a porno movie?
well... i don't think that'd work.
i need thirty.  calculate in, also, the cash you don't have to front...
this ain't no social call.  one hundred bucks.  to find my father.
virge, that's a misdemeanor.  you go down there to arrest 'em, something goes wrong, maybe this time somebody gets his head broke, suddenly it's a mess and it won't end there, you'll have cowboys comin' around lookin' for trouble from here to christmas. you gonna risk all that over a misdemeanor?
- that's what i mean!
you will, dil
you're compulsive.
once you look at it, you're going to want to buy it from me. that's guaranteed. and that's the price: five bucks. so if you're not willing to spring for it, you might as well not bother to look. it'll just tear you up inside and make you miserable.
sobering...
playing...
hospital food.
that's what we all used to call him when he was a kid -- cause he was always quacking.  never shut up.
so do i, kev.
forget it, i can't explain it...
because she says if i don't watch out i'll have a baby.
you think it's a conspiracy?
pardon me.  i hate to break up the staff meeting, but they're here! birthday guests at three o'clock!
let's go.
oh, sure.  siddown, siddown. marty, tell her siddown.
i'll keep it in my office room.
o.k.! send that!
have you gone to the police?
naw! he wouldn't have cared. just give him a good performance and he'll be happy and i've got a feeling you'll do just that.
hey jeff. i'm feelin' so much better.
wanna be a part of history?
it may sound that way, but i react out of fear.  my life has nothing to do with what i like or don't like.  you haven't been listening, have you?
santos... i can't...
i cannot bear to look at that hideous suit one minute more.
are we going to do this again?
oh, since when?
go out with me.
it's okay.
it's not an "alley". i hate when people call it a "bowling alley", it's so common! i prefer "bowling center".
nothing. can i open my eyes?
sooner than later.  you really need to.
yeah, sometimes.  i like to dabble, too.
what do you think?  he said in life there's no free ride.
fine, fine. you know, your dedication to this patient is an inspiring thing, treves. but you must remember that this is a hospital, and there are many patients here. patients who can be made well, and you owe them your first consideration. just don't become so obsessed, old man, that you begin to neglect them.
i can see it all now. this is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at fotomat this summer. you bought forty bucks of fuckin' film and you never even talked to her.
yeah, but three days is kinda the money...
you have the right to remain silent.  if you give up that right...
how about i pick one out for you?
sombitch and i ain't never been to beantown.
rules are made to be broken.
i don't know. you just seem really familiar to me. never mind. enjoy your meals.
what girl, what does she know?  why don't you let her hold the baby once in a while?! your mother, boy, she wantsa take the kid for a day, that's fine!
do you believe it?
ask her, she's a heroic fireperson. she does this twenty times a day.
i told him not to sit down in there.....
i don't want excuses, i want that weird-looking stuff called "cash."
good, ted. piggy back ride?
well, we were worried about dust and debris from the work being done ruining the cameras, so--
this must be the last straw.
but i don't remember anything. what did you tell 'em?
that would give us only three seconds to revive him...
today.
sure thing. i don't have to know what i'm doing, long as you know.
this is a science excursion corporal. just stay out of the way.
bill, why don't you ask her... she's your special friend.
be it so ordered. the tribunal will examine all the evidence presented here and in due time render a verdict on the proposed indictment and on the disposition of the deviate in question.  this hearing is adjourned.
out.  if dad doesn't care enough about us to be here on his birthday, then why should i care? i'm going to a movie.
haven't seen him for years. that's the truth.
it's mother, sidney, now be a good girl and turn on the news. do it!
of course.
don't talk nonsense.
i believe there's a kinder name for it, wesley. at st. thomas, it's called the institute for mental therapy.
'yes' is the answer to your question.
it's all right, we're okay.
you will?  excellent, alright, this is great.  you will, really?
you weren't at my game.
oh -- please - don't let me interrupt finish your phone call.
mary --
no thanks, birdie.
that's the loch ness monster.  and... kay-- that's... 444-eyes?
st. mike's.
let me hang on with two hands or i will fall.
i'm okay.  i'm okay.
keep trying.
yeah. me too.
what have you been told so far?
i didn't.  it was a present from a guy.
i said i was sorry.
the police always do, don't they?
yeah, i guess so.  what are you going to do now that you're home?
nine days – tuesday –
you know.  look at me like -- like i look at women.
because i was like you once. and there was no one there to help me.
in kowloon, once, i got one that said, "live now because life is dust."
tell me what it was.
maybe because we're not supposed to be having sex with bananas.
you know i can't talk about that.
what's that?
i did shave... do i seem hairy? peter laughs.
we!
well. the prom's coming up.
pull the plug.  get her out of there.
no ...
they've made contact with the reapers.
havana, cuba...?
i'm not kidding.  i want to get out of here - now, ok.
susan?
he saw the wire.
how about ciudad juarez? you could take a local, arrives in two hours, and transfer in albuquerque. it'll get you across the border.
if it has to be--do you mind if i do it myself?  oh, i don't mean with the gun. this is no trick.  when i wrote that note you have in your pocket-- that was no trick either.  it's not so hard for me as you think. i'm not crying about it, i've been skating close to it for quite some time.  the water is cold down there--  but so is everything else.  and there's you.
it doesn't mean anything.  it was written before i went out there.  before the ho.
getting rid of my hub!
oh--yikes!
well no, like i said, woo peed on the rug--
you'll be going over the fucking edge if you come anywhere near me next friday night.
what the hell.  for you....
then they were right.  i am evil. this is god's punishment.
'k-k-kay, mack!
where you been? i saw the cops rousting you at the rally.
whose side are you on, cauchon?
it's up to you entirely. don't leave, then ...
i'm not lying to you, i'm not --
you better have a warrant.  that's my notebook, you've got no right to be sticking your fingers into it.
yeah, but these guys have never seen a horse.  they just jack off to clint eastwood.
you see max cherry in the dress department. we're about to be handed half-a-million dollars -- man, look at me when i'm talking to you! and you don't think nothing of him being there!
well here is the problem at hand: the king has ordered me to discover the identity of the governor general of jesuits, and kill him.  as our english rivals have left the catholic church, louis has struck on a plan to dominate the whole of europe by uniting church and state and making himself head of both.  he has already picked the pope.  only the jesuits, who put god above throne or papacy, stand in his way.
who was?
i'm-- yes.  yes, i'm fine.  i'm fine.  how are you?
what made you ask such a question?
nope, you got a little surprise over there, shorty.
your calendar, your cell phone, your whoo pig sooey hat, some pictures of that ketch you wanted.
my papa taught me one thing: don't never bullshit a west indian bullshit artist.
just five.  it's the economy... you think maybe one of them is not who they seem?
i do understand that. i'll get right on it. and thank you.
they said i was dogged?
a universe of sensation is waiting for you... don't you want to explore it... with me?
oh, i had the radio on.
amazing. i'm johns.
'paranoia is what separates the secured from the unsecured.'
you're saying this only to make me go.
i need time for thinking.  without you hanging on my coattails for a change.
yeah, well he just turned up in new jersey at the military command post. somehow all this is related to what happened down in panama. there's a story here. i know it. you got any tape or glue?
it is not that i care for <u>you</u>--but that i posses an enquiring mind.  what will you <u>do</u> when i am gone?  when you have nothing to occupy your thoughts, save the memory of your own folly, and, more to the point, stupidity.
mainly.  and also that i'm proud -- very proud -- to be your son.
yes, but sometimes i'm still not sure which side of the wall i'm on.
lemon or lime?
tina, i'll be right back.
the united nations. madmen are on the streets, paul. but i will take care of you.  your cellar is well-stocked, right?
learning our history! the last 5000 years that she missed! she's been out of circulation a while, you know.
she's not home yet. take off your coat and come in the living room. i'll make you a drink. i wanna talk to you.
it will scarcely be considered credible, perhaps, but our whole business consisted in eating cherries together.
put something in his room.  what does he like?
simone does not control my destiny.
you will not carry any other pagers with you. you will not carry anything, for that matter, that i have not just given you.
songs. 'he's a rebel', 'leader of the pack', 'town without pity', that dusty springfield song 'i only want to be with you'. that's what i hear anyway. her behaviour was the main thing the doctors' report used against you. so even if she would see me, which she won't, i couldn't put her on camera anyway. if i ask her, 'mallory, are you insane?' and she starts singing 'dead skunk in the middle of the road', that blows our whole case.
better late than never, right?
go???
-- should you happen upon anything that might be relevant.
thanks for your help.
the quiet can fool you.  it fooled me.  you can never be sure of what's out there.
well then - yes.  of course.
you tell on me, i tell on you.
chasing the dragon?  whaddya mean?  you sure you don't want a pancake?
what?!
might i suggest tucking your pants into your socks? to prevent mouse intrusion.
how do you know that?
look, mr. jefferies. i'm not educated. i'm not even sophisticated. but i can tell you this -- when a man and a woman see each other, and like each other -- they should come together -- wham like two taxies on broadway. not sit around studying each other like specimens in at bottle.
i don't buy that reform story for a minute. and even if i did, i certainly don't believe he would send you to protect her. so why?
ch-charlie m!
no!
now what happened? i'll bet hunk did that.
that's right, preacher. i robbed that bank because i got tired of seein' children roamin' the woodlands without food, children roamin' the highways in this year of depression; children sleepin' in old abandoned car bodies on junk-heaps; and i promised myself i'd never see the day when my youngins'd want.
i always get my man.
no.
several possession charges, but nothing major.
now who are we talking about?
on earth.
you don't think he's mixed up in -
i finally knew what i wanted when i grew up.
right here. bodega bay.
the witness is excused; take him out.
each egg has to be perfect.
his son-in-law damn near killed me.
who all ended up wearing candles for faces...  swayzak's up to his ass in this somehow. guy can barely hold a drink in his hand, he's so scared.
mom, i'm sorry, they're beatin' me left and right.  ma, i'm sorry. i'm all upset.
what kinda trash talk is that?
sam, haddonfield is a hundred and fifty miles from here. how could he get there? he can't drive.
what, doctor?
oh. how about before that?
that's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  don't be offended, lad.  a man who's got no ethics is a free man.  i envy that.  beside, how can i blame you?  that grace sure has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she?  eh?
c'mon, i see what i can do.
smells like teenage spirit.
okay -- what if i did have a book down my trousers?
sometimes.
just which constitutional amendment protects our right to peddle pcp?
what did you say?
i gotta get something to eat, i haven't eaten all day.
now learn something about yourself.
so whoever built this--
i must say, your beauty is unpar- alleled.  truly you belong here with us among the clouds.
well, if it's my last story, i'd like it to be a good one. but -- i guess i can't, walter.
they are a body of asteroids that make a complete circuit of the universe once every 12.3 trillion years. the phoenix asteroids... from what i've heard, doolittle, they glow... glow with all the colors of the rainbow. nobody knows why. they just glow as they drift around the universe. imagine all the sights they've seen in the time they've been travelling -- the birth and death of stars, things we'll never see. the universe is alive, doolittle. i thought it was all empty, but it isn't. in between the stars, it's seething with light and gasses and dust. there are little pebbles drifting around, planets no one on earth has ever seen... no one but the phoenix asteroids...
let's go.
i was warned.
what is this thing that kills me?
you're incorrigible!
why?
his name's james f. grantz, john g. check		   * your tattoos.							 *
yes you do. we were calling you gay boy and you got so mad....
i see.  but i hope you have a lot of sugar.  eli is ready to go to zook's.
or what she was worth.
the advances you speak of were the result of countless years of study and empirical experimentation, a careful evolutionary process, not chalkboard parlor-tricks.
starving.
gee.  you really think?
back where?
i see. where is this gun?
burn!
must be.
agnes...
from who?  toothpick charlie, maybe?
i don't understand.
go where?
let's hit "kelly's."
you know what the word glimpse means, j? it’s by nature an impermanent thing.
yeah, really!
oh, my poor stomach.
hello. this is mr. dorchester in records. we're looking for kathy costello...
i love her but that doesn't mean i need to meet her.
how dead?
lab experiments? right smart guy -- paul, you know your mother's gonna be disappointed not to see more of you -- in fact, let me make this more than a simple request guy, i think you should...
give me one hour to get inside him exactly.
find a lawyer?
i missed you at the funeral home. santos said you were here.
you are here and there is no place to go...
what's the obvious stuff?
at school, she kept mostly to the japanese kids, and sort of ignored me.  as if all of our times alone together...in the hollow cedar, everywhere...were a secret.
sure.
ready when you are.
there's an autopsy ordered at bellevue immediately. you better skip over there.
it depends on what way you want to go.
no, i'm fine.
blue is phones?
i'm serious. we forget he's just a child. i wish you'd speak to him.
my friends, the great experiment: excelsior, ready for trial runs...
well what?
you promised to let me kiss you.
of course.
i dream'd a dream to-night.
people might be better off.  they thought about it, spent the evening back in the...
i don't know.  he sent me.  i'm george.
please jeffrey.  i don't want to be responsible for any delayed after- effects.
you can't get away with..
doctor, always try to do the right thing.
great minds think alike.
jimmy.  i don't know.  i got so much else on my mind.  i got the kids.  we got no money.
doing what?
enchante.
did not.
i told you i don't know anything about any fucking set up. i've only been on the force eight months, nobody tells me anything! i don't know anything! you can torture me if you want -
how could i forget about you?  you're the only person i know.
sure. see ya.
saavik, sir. we were told you'd need a helmsman -  ... so i volunteered.
no...i'll be ok for a week.
i can't speak for him.
this is kind of a stream--
yeah, i think so.
so i should feel happy that he got away with it?
you can't hate yourself just because your dad's a twisted freak.
but i'm going to have to leave 'em here. they're --- well they're not the sort of people you're used to.
that's right.  our motives are selfish, so we're cooperating.
hello, frank.
i do what i do.
where do you get your ideas?
if he isn't, then he's stupid.
it's him... it's him.
c'mon ... you're exaggerating. the orders were to shoot him in the back.
where's kurtz? i want to talk to him.
would you mind if i did? i'd like to talk to him.
he's gotta take that call ... if there is one.
you can keep your fucking fuel --
you're almost there, you can do it -- can do -- can do.
like your cocaine, i suppose.  the "high" lasts several hours.  we would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor.
sunlight.
muscle? i don't know that one.
i did.
oh, you know exactly what i mean, honey? it'd make the future so simple and nice.
must be. trubshaw's busy. i'll send mother ...
no.
dick, don't push me right now.
get it!
in here!
downstairs.  there must be an extension.  oh my god --
well, all this needs thinking about, son. i mean we can't very well just kick joe out... not just like that, can we? i mean joe is here doing a job. a contract it is, two years. well, we made like an arrangement, didn't we joe? you see, son, joe's paid next month's rent already so, well, whatever we do in the future, we cant just say to joe to get out, now can we?
okay.
what does it mean?
dodgson, dodgson.  we got dodgson here!  see, nobody cares.  nice hat. what are you trying to look like, a secret agent?
...hoppi-hoppa.
so maybe you'll come too?
you the only cat don't come on with that "whatcha know, daddy" jive; and you don't cuss none.
no bank roll there, boy.  lucky i could get you signed on--they picked up that pittsburgh jeweler--made him talk. the heat's on, shortie--and those atlantic breezes are going to be mighty welcome.
what the hell are you talking about?  what’s he talking about?
come on, daddy, pull my coat. what happens if you give all that up? you get sick or somethin'? i pulled a hustle once and got out of the draft.
what?
we're nearly there, lucilla.
hey! fuckin' a! just... just like a hot shit... except cold.
you cannot walk away from this. you cannot.
dick? dick who?
will you stop being silly, stewart?
i am not sure... it could be twice the distance.
what's it look like?
twenty eight.
i don't know. that's why i came to see mrs. redi. i'm trying to find her.
one shuts it down, one turns arms it.
shut up, starling...
pop leibel owns the argosy book shop. what do you want to know?
the vow of obedience.
you mustn't be afraid.
yes.
it had to come, i reckon, soon or later.
yeah. right. all the things that make life worth living.
what are these?
these are the worst years. i tell you. it's gonna happen to you. i'm afraida look inna mirror. i'm afraid i'm gonna see an old lady with white hair, like the old ladies inna park, little bundles inna black shawl, waiting for the coffin. i'm fifty- six years old. what am i to do with myself? i have strength in my hands. i wanna cook. i wanna clean. i wanna make dinner for my children. am i an old dog to lie in fronta the fire til my eyes close? these are the terrible years, theresa! terrible years!
you've got a <u>phone</u>?
husband?
oh, pony's band "dream girls"? been on the road opening for "midnight hore". stadiums, man.  wait, so pony's coming by here?
and-and maybe, um...maybe we could discuss it sometime.
we'll consider it a prisoner exchange.
thank you.
it was very strange. he called me at six this morning. hobbes called me. i thought i was dreaming. i haven't heard that voice for so long. he told me who it was, then he said something like, 'meet me at apartment 1208 at noon. i want you to go out for lunch with me. it's time you furthered your education.' then he laughed and hung up. i went back to sleep. he called me again at eight to remind me to come.
but... only when no one is looking.
yeah.  if you can step up and actually do it.  understand?  'stead of just talking the talk.
those checks take forever.
you must have told them we shocked him into a grinning idiot. two roadblocks and an all-points bulletin wouldn't stop a five-year-old!
insomnolesence...
shhhh! this is the national anthem.
well. i told my mother that we were to be married. and she got well. right away.
looks like it, yeah.
oh yeah! better be good and hurry away then! who knows? we might be being watched! maybe one of your stupid french companies has got a detective prying into your life - after all, that’s what they do to their employees, isn’t it? huh! hope you enjoy ruining people’s lives. thanks for the lift!
i'm surprised donna didn't say anything.
he has a gift and with that gift comes responsibility. and you don't understand that he's at a fragile point--
yeah but oh man,  wouldn't you just love to get one of those gibsons, baby? ooooh!
aren't you coming back with me?
i mean, i'm a deist.  a belief i share with the likes of tom jefferson and ben franklin.  surely you knew that.
i know. i'm going to go there tonight...
no! let me go!
...all of you owe time and i thought tonight would be a good time to---
very likely. you're not exactly catching us at our best.
yes...i'm uh...i'm fine.
there's just one thing i want to know.
yes.
i think so.
...have a nice day mr. stone.  ... mr. gekko, the conference call is ready. mr. sugarman and mr. lorenzo in delaware. mr. bernard in los angeles. mr. jackson and ms. rosco in london. they're all on.
yeah.
do you want to take a session?
i'm fine are you ok?
oh, i'm sorry.  did i embarrass you, sweetheart?  oh...
thanks, dad.
it was time for our paths to cross.
yeah?  what happened?
i didn't mean to.
but you are... i know your 'diary of the clone wars' by heart.  my father...
how do you know if you've never tried?
crabs would get most of the newborns before they made it to the sea, huh?
this is your room, malcolm. i know you'll keep it clean.
good.  he never doubted you.
there are things you didn't tell me.
i had it at four.
it's his father sir.  he's suffocating him.  we've all seen it...
you know what i mean.
you knew my jody?
yeah, i'm just gettin' old. i can't smoke or laugh now it seems without coughing.
'daddy has to go now.
you go.  send me a postcard.
behind in your dues? how much?
sir...
rose, you and brother wait in the car. i want to speak for a moment lo mr. hillyer.
right now, i'm more worried about my mother than anything. they won't let her see my father.
no, i'm just running scared, same as everyone else.
would that marcus had lived.
there's nothing harder.
why?
atten-hut!
the inertial navigation system. must have been knocked out in the crash.
i rest.
up to?
i don't know...  one of us has to be here in case arbogast's on the way.
you are weak!  i have seen it. the force is strong with him. he must be destroyed.
i'm sure you haven't done anything. have some iced tea. how are the kids?
faith, i'm kidding.  is this how you plan to get what you want from life?  when you finally find it, you turn and run away from it?
the point... 
yes. i put that dress away. when the germans march out, i'll wear it again.
i don't know. it's early... i love you.
what are you talking about? we didn't kill her ...
we're too far away to walk. don't you understand?
well, wasn't all me, y'know.
of course, he's only here two days a week. he's also on staff over at loma vista.
peter, i'm in no mood to hear childish prattle!
yeah, he tried to hide it but i saw 'em, and a little bit he says to me, "you know, you are beautiful." now wasn't that a nice thing for a doctor to say to a patient, wasn't it? what could cheer a girl up more?
how much did you have?
now isn't that just too cute? there's a brain behind that face of yours, isn't there? you've got everything nicely figured out, for yourself, including this.
that's up to you field guys.  h.q. wants you to break 'em in when you do the annual security sweep in january.
who?
knows ? he watches every "guest" on tape. this whole place is here for his sick amusement. and no so are we.
&lt;&lt;i'll tell you everything. i'11 even say it slow enough for you to understand it. just tell this man i want protection. real protection.&gt;&gt;
she was a delta gamma! not in my pledge class or anything -- she graduated five years ahead of me. but i used to take her class at the la sports club. she's amazing!
could you handle it if it was in a good cause?
s.a.c. darius michaud never tried or intended to defuse the bomb.
like your step-brother sebastian. i can't believe they didn't expel him after what he did to the school nurse.
where then?
relax, it's casual.
it has to do with my father.
yeah, well ... she lives with district court judge seymour croft ...
oh, shut up!  in a couple of days, everything will be just the way it was.  they'll see... they'll see. i'm still andy's favorite toy.
bet!
what do you really want?
me?
just making me feel like a piece of meat.
there is something missing here.
absolutely not. in fact, i picked up a bride yesterday; except she was a singer.
she's unbelievable. who needs satellites when we've got dolores's mouth?
well--i am madame colet.
tick.  not to dash your hopes, but i don't deal this kind of product, you know that.  i'll give you four for it, cause i've gotta cut off the last bit.  and my customers want uncut.
we got no choice.
i know!  i know!
oh, like jekyll and hyde!  ah, i've always wanted to play jekyll and hyde!  i'm looking forward to this production.
-- an angel dust dealer --
yeah, nice meetin' yuh.
mrs. mathews, your daughter is dead. she's dead.
of course not.  thanks for telling me.  i haven't seen mr. clarendon.
he don't talk as much as you, i give him points for that.
...what is this?
i had to get in there. a deep adjustment. rest a moment and let it set a bit.
trent, i don't feel like going out tonight. i got shit to do tomorrow...
why would he send this to helen hudson...
i can't take shorthand, mr. kane -
what's wrong?
i...?  i saw it.  i was there.
i don't know.  probably next friday.
we will be happy to beam down. but first we must have certain assurances.
yes.
josephine actually went to the congo last year.
hmmmmmmmmm?
yes. i really would.
good evening. you see, here we are again.
i feel like somebody hit me upside da head with a sledgehammer.
108 and still active?
thank you.
are you nuts? get out of there!
in about fifteen minutes.
from the surveillance footage in the bloodbank.  he was one of the guard's nomak attacked.
eleven.
groovy. smashing! good on ya!  nice tie. yea capitalism!
--deep throat?--
if you did it wrong, it would be painful. you'd choke to death.
what do you want me to do about it?
you bet i do, sir.
i'll take you with me.
for what?
mints?
you shouldn't have.
youthful high spirits.
anger.  rage.  frustration.
he said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.
ohhhh i started this, didn't i, didn't i, didn't i, fuck.
point conceeded, mr. macleod.
so, what happened to ms. caperelli's checking with outside counsel first, all that crap?
this is a different world - is what i tell myself.  a different life. and here i am a different wife.
my brother, tom hagen.
no, let's stick to that strategy till we see whether you boys can do two things. the first is get that halfback out of the game. he had one year with the rams before the army got him, but he didn't play too often because he's one of those hot dogs.
hey, bugs don't take prisoners.
i always tell you the truth, remo.
it's going into replication.
forget it.  one false move, and they'll toss us off the train - there'll be the police, and the papers, and the mob in chicago...
bork! you are a federal agent. you represent the united states government... never end a sentence with a preposition. try again.
sixty days.  here.  don't mention it.
right standard rudder, z plus five degrees...
it's terrific!
just a minute –– just a minute. now, hold on, mr. potter. you're right when you say my father was no business man. i know that. why he ever started this cheap, penny-ante building and loan, i'll never know. but neither you nor anybody else can say anything against his character, because his whole life was . . . why, in the twenty-five years since he and uncle billy started this thing, he never once thought of himself. isn't that right, uncle billy? he didn't save enough money to send harry to school, let alone me. but he did help a few people get out of your slums, mr. potter. and what's wrong with that? why . . . here, you're all businessmen here. doesn't it make them better citizens? doesn't it make them better customers? you . . . you said . . . what'd you say just a minute ago? . . . they had to wait and save their money before they even ought to think of a decent home. wait! wait for what? until their children grow up and leave them? until they're so old and broken-down that they . . . do you know how long it takes a working man to save five thousand dollars? just remember this, mr. potter, that this rabble you're talking about . . . they do most of the working and paying and living and dying in this community. well, is it too much to have them work and pay and live and die in a couple of decent rooms and a bath? anyway, my father didn't think so. people were human beings to him, but to you, a warped, frustrated old man, they're cattle. well, in my book he died a much richer man than you'll ever be!
yeah, but we still haven't found any treasure.
yeah, i haven't really absorbed that one.
there's more than one?
i don't know.  till we figure it out, let's ... let's keep dancing.
it is important to assure the succession.
well -- here's how it is ...tom sharp, eli higgins and a couple of others been talking to me about -- that new sort of organization -- grange they call it. what you think about it?
but that doesn't add, does it.
i was, because if you said "yes" right away, i wouldn't get to say this next part.  and i've been practicing it.  ready?
no, thank heaven.
no...
so she feels... what he feels... while he's in her.  the thrill while he's killing her... is sent to her, heightening her fear... which in turn heightens the turn on for him.  i've seen a lot, max.
so, you're really gonna be a lawyer?
no, listen.  you have no idea of the kind of pressure i'm under right now.
oh shit!
that food...  ugh, i feel like i'm gonna puke.
if kat's not going, you're not going.
i don't know.  it just feels right.
make it ten. i am only a poor corrupt official.
oh, yes. i heard.
you mean, no prints but hers?
this is prince imhotep, high priest of osiris.
i'm not into finger foods.  too fussy.
i've already wasted my whole life. i want to tell you with my last breath... i have always loved you. i would rather be a ghost, drifting by your side... as a condemned soul... than enter heaven without you.  because of your love... i will never be a lonely spirit.
yah.
duck!
i don't care. i'm gonna drop it. i'm gonna drop it. i'm...
you did, i know you did.
one hundred and sixteen minutes.
you are this museum.  it won't be the same without you.
and i'm from mattel.  well, i'm not actually  from mattel, i'm actually from a smaller company that was purchased in a leveraged buy-out. well, i don't really understand the financials, but...
i had 'em too. i burnt those two starky and hutch motherfuckers down. then their asses lucked out and found that coke.
and you wouldn't want to explode on the basis of false data, would you?
then it's worth the journey.
i'm not drunk. yet.
no, i won't wait -- i can't -- every day is precious -- every hour -- every minute.
you have acquaintances - business friends and superficial golf buddies. you have always been a fringe player. you have some serious male on male intimacy problems.
oh, those. why do you ask?
i'm not sure i know you well enough -- i don't think i'm comfortable.
it's sunday.
is it your dish?
you seen this girl? say... within the last 24 hours.
so what. infatuation is good, too.
i didn't...
how?
cutting edge mathematics. think tanks. the kind of place where a mind like will's is given free reign.
wasn't my idea.
it's a mess, right now.  that's my project when i get back.
yes.
buff, you got to stop making shit up. it didn't happen.
what in the world would give me that idea?
no, he's not.
how are you paying tor the braces, donnie?
why, what's gonna happen?
it's a romantic and tragic drink.
i know, dad!
i don't know.
i am not an aristocrat, as you are... but i must still respect a woman's duties.
tyler...
no, philip, i don't want you coming back here.  and if you want to talk to me -- <u>call</u>.
captain spenser.  elliott.  i ... what the hell is going on?
well, i try to keep an open mind, but...
i'm not much good at handwriting. or parties.
not that i'm in contact with.
what do you think happened on this boat?
and, <u>with</u> disrespect, constable, if jails and courts overflow, it is testimony to success, not failure.
how's your wife?
what're you, nuts?
wade -- i've been working toward this audition for years.
you'd better get dr. woodly.
if you come to hawaii --
i'm not a--ah, fuck it, just stay away from my fucking lady friend, man.
three days.  i was worried about you. how are you feeling?
yeah.  go on, beat it.
well... okay... but only as a friend.
yeah.
yes, around here.  i was a mayishan in cuba before i come here.  manuel the mayishan was my name.
i know, but we all got to work out our own problems, henry.
you been acrost?
it's what you want?
i appreciate your cooperation. i'm looking for a missing girl...  ...this girl here, denise willis... have you seen her?
jezzie! my feet are throbbing!
oh! ho! okay. you wanna go?
you think bad, and bad is what you get.
we have a dead woman bleeding all over the bathroom. what options? call the police.
hey, easy now.
who kept the other half?
yes? i'm trying.
you're the best nurse i can think of--
why?
if i could trouble the baron to come and see this beautiful room. i have ordered champagne. perhaps the baroness could join us.
no - nothing.  besides, it's none of our business if you guys want to knock each other off -
you know, my dream has always been to just chuck it all and become an artist... living in a garret, poor but free!
how important would it have to be? it's only murder, inspector.
you betrayed us.
which is--
probably.
please, i beg you.  take him away from here --
yes, we've had it retrofitted with a secure cellular phone, an on-board computer, and a global geosynchronous positioning device. oh, and finally, this.
i'd prefer it if you didn't speak to me.
he died because he bled to death from a blow to his head. someone had to have given him it.
when i play bridge with all the girls, everyone has what to talk about with their sons. they show pictures. their sons are lawyers and doctors and rabbis. why can't i show a picture?
yes, professor oldman's group. forgive me. i didn't mean to frighten you.
st. anne's?
here comes your father, tell him so yourself.
that i cannot tell you.
can't you bite me and then i'll be like you?
if title dictated my behavior, as a clerk serving the public, i wouldn't be allowed to spit a mouthful of water at that guy. but i did, so my point is that people dictate their own behavior. hence, even though i'm a clerk in this video store, i choose to go rent videos at big choice.  agreed?
but i-- .
he's obsessed with his own image.  he wants his nobel peace prize a little too much.  as the late "doctor" king proved -- even an ape can win a prize with good press.
and neither will i.
yes... we can go forward on this course, but it means going directly through the heart.
look out for number one. always number one.  i should've known you wouldn't tell me. pop said johnny friendly used to own you. i think he still owns you.  no wonder everybody calls you a bum.
good.  very good...
do you still want to do something tonight?
she intends to change the future somehow.
all directions are the same here.
now? she's a night manager at mcdonalds.
it grew.
that's the rub.  i liked wade.  who's ryan?  if they're both standing in front of me and i have to shoot one or the other, how do i choose?  look at my hand, there it goes again.
i'll destroy whatever's in the case.
will you just relax, mon? he's not gonna kill us. my father is a television repairman. he's got all kinds of tools. i can fix-this car.
all right.  it's a beginning.  las vegas, nevada.
this man's still alive.
first, i would like to say i love the show.  it's very courageous. my parents marched in selma, alabama with dr. king.
good night!
you're just scared.  i know rehab is hard, and you have to worry about whether you'll be as good as you were but you will be.  i believe in you.  you just have to get back on the court.  like you'd get back on a horse.
like what?
i'm a little short.  i've been out of work.  let me owe you the money for a few weeks.
yeah, man, it means love, respect, community... and the dollars too. the package.  the kwan.
screw you too, kitty.
i told you.  if he sees me here with another guy, he's gonna think i'm here with another guy.  i just don't want to send any confusing signals.
on account of they seen you was beatin' on their friend.
can i see some of the other tapes to get an idea of what --
we need men like you here, to be sure that our community will continue to thrive. in return for which, shangri-la has much to give you. you are still, by the world's standards, a youngish man. yet in the normal course of existence, you can expect twenty or thirty years of gradually diminishing activity. here, however, in shangri- la, by our standards your life has just begun, and may go on and on.
out where?
and how do you think this addresses the subject of racism?
thank you.
tell me about it. what are you angry about?
name it.
he did?
same here.
well forgive me if i don't think of you as the world's safest bet.
yeah, how do i know?
smart s.o.b.  he put it together piece by piece.
who's "we"?
i do, i do.  i'm sure i'm just...how was your day?
aaaahhhh!
...petrov and cicerno for sure...
give it to me.
satch, would you listen to me here.  just you and me.  can i talk to you here, alone?
who are these ruffians?... i've never seen them before in my life! ... 
inspector halloran, that is so much bullshit, you don't like or admire me, but the beautiful part is i don't give a fuck.  that's the upside of having a breakdown.
i wish they'd tell us what they're going to do with us.
castor's still alive --  technically.  he's a turnip, on total life-support ...
why, because you're my security consultant?  this cocksucker nearly burnt my house down.
you can't just walk in, either.
you don't even know it man, but you're a god damn hero.
how would you like to get a ticket next week? haven't you any romance in you?
i'm sorry.
dad?
i do.
yes.
elaine, look, i'm in the middle of sone stuff right now... i'm not gonna have time to come by. i don't know when i can get there.
no. but i can bypass it with one of these
we're doing episode 31, jason?
i did not steal the truck.
you want, i tole you you can come. you all right, foley.  i like you.
don't go busting my balls. okay?
yes! the workhouse!
wow. you've had quite an evening.
"the dark inside..."? i don't understand.
of course, dumpling. its very nice of ted but...
convinced her she needed to visit her mom in san mateo.
what he talk 'bout?
bah!  you faeries have the morals of ferrets.
hablar slowly, por favor.  my ingles no es bien.
get out of my way.
....i have seven.
walter, you're wonderful in a loathesome sort of way. now, would you mind keeping quiet long enough for me to tell you what i came up here for?
i'm here.
kent, kent for chrissakes.  you must be eleanor.
don't ever stare him down.
old woman?
i'm not going out there! let's wait for the real police...
how do you think i'm doing?
peter, this is serious.  i need to know if you think there's anything unusual about him.
sure.
tell me what you really think.
let us put it to the test. protect yourself with every scientific precaution you can think of. i'll go out on the cliff and build a votive fire to hermes -- not that i believe in him any more than i do in science.
what do <u>you</u> think?  what i need from you:  i need a base of operations.  some place in the district.  i need some clean <u>money</u> ...
isn't that the same thing?
i can get into the crawlspace from my closet and climb all over the house.
that don't justify trying to trap a boy by getting pregnant, lynette! nothing justifies that. i can't believe you're even thinking like that. i mean, that's really backward.
she's a ho cause she's sending her coochie through the mail.
i'm...tuesday evening we're having an informal dinner, i didn't know you'd be 'on set,' but if you'd like to join your...
good for him.  thanks a lot, freddie!  kevin. we're going grocery shopping.
well, i'm afraid that's a question that's all too easy to answer.
well, i can't get out and look, king.  but i don't get a green light.
i must have been out of my head.
and then you'll be happy?
i don't know. the cheeks maybe... look a little --
dear, you're a scientist. don't you believe your own eyes?
faster! don't we have another gun?
not at all.
we decided the night before last, before we came up here...
i'd like to talk to him.
peter kelson?
how much money has he got?
just play one set of downs. i told them you were great.
well, i guess now that guy's dead, it don't really matter... it was about the people hanging around the office that summer.  i wasn't really part of the operation, you know.  i was handling the private-eye work for guy when that came in - not much did - but that's why i was there... it was a nuthouse.  there were all these cubans coming and going.  they all looked alike to me.
you know, frederic-fucking-chopin.
to the commissary to get this boy some clothes! i'm gon' get everybody somethin'!
"trychtichlorate is a binary structured --"
go away -- hide yourself.
know what?
i'm sure.  when you've led the kind of life that i have, there are debts that must be paid.  maybe i can balance the scales a little.
gotta tell you this about my daughter. my daughter makes real good time, even in a long dress and heels.  maggie may not be hale's longest running joke, but she certainly is the fastest.
you quit.
come on, i'm freezing.
mary -- you've talked to me as you might have talked to your father and i believe he wants me to help you a little. you see, sometimes we think we're licked in this life -- but we weren't put here to be licked. don't you believe it. sometimes the shadows seem to get hold of us -- the shadows and the evil -- but it is still up to us to fight. now i was thinking before you came, of coming over to cross corners end of the month, to get acquainted with my godson -- and other things.
i don't want to lie down. i've been lying down enough.
yeah.  now's not a good time.
oh, she'd love it.
the empire won't look for you out here.  i'd say you're all set ... which means it's time for me to get going.
louie!
well, i was hoping you might stop by my office to swear out a criminal deposition against some of your friends and co-workers.
it's...the anniversary. that's what's going on...take it easy on yourself.
the event horizon's computer think's it's 2034.
whatever nekhorvich was carrying sean wanted and he wanted to conceal the fact that he took it.
well, yes, it's just a manner of speech from your post corrective advisor to you that you watch out, little alex. he puts his arm round alex's shoulder.
arline?
yes, you did.
"save yourself. from hell."  what are you saying, are you saying that this ship is possessed?
you know... 
wow. that's big. i mean sex is a really big deal. you shouldn't do it until you know you've found the right person.
no. but i fear it's intention may have been to kill the peace accords and spark a civil war between the hutu militia and the tutsi rebels.
no, no.  i saw eight geese flying in a "v".
no.
oh yes.
that was then.  i'm better since the lobotomy.
i called mel weintraub this morning, to check for availability.
i just love mechanical things.
when i go off?
i'm sorry... i can't hear you. i can't turn my head all the way yet... tell her we can't hear her.
trust me, you don't. i actually have to wear a bra now. and i have to rub this nasty cocoa butter stuff all over myself or my skin could get stretched too far and explode.
no, i celebrate at the beginning of my corporate tax year which is march first. that way i beat the crowds.
what's that?
not for you.
lookin' good.
now listen here, you little bastard, just you turn around and walk out of here the same way as you came in. alex eyes a giant white, fibreglass phallic sculpture on the table beside him.
you were right: it was arrogant presumption that got us into this situation. you might have died.
in space, no one can hear you sweat.
pain cuts the deepest, isn't that what you said?
no.
not a tiny little vial -
i want the truth.
of course. no one ever shuts up in the libary. kids were whispering about it all day.
funnier things have happened. ma says when pa was courting her, he acted strange for months. didn't make sense--or anything. and one day, on a hunch, ma said: "clayton, so help me, you talk like a man whose collar is too tight to bear." "not the collar, mary," he said, "my shoes." "well, for land's sake," ma said, "take the pesky things off!" which pa did, an' they were engaged within a week.
i wasn't talking about real friends. why doesn't gus like me.
why? why he have to ask? can't nobody offer? what's going on? since when a black man come to town have to sleep in the cellar like a dog?!
--bradlee went to harvard--
good luck.
see?  you big dullard.
and if he's not...?
satisfied with your cabin?
the past six months.
he was a good judge, but that was a long time ago.
no, i'm fine.
good, you can get this under control now.
what?
and if we fail, and lose our carriers, we destroy our ability to fight them at all.  as soon as the second wave returns, we will withdraw.
i'm the one what?
they're from my old convent.
i didn't dive.
yeah i like him. don't you like him? hey what's going on? what is this?
man, he won't like that. beaumont don't got a doin' time disposition.
i need my sodding parents' consent.
saturday night, yes, sir.  have a pleasant journey!
i hit him square.
yeah, i guess.  there's still a payment, ain't there?
tell you my secrets.
why would i be angry?  it was beautiful.
in the chest.
it's never over...  here comes another six years of bad dreams.
i wasn't talking about madeleine.
yeah, i, we both live downtown.
but you can breathe it.
no!  i...don't think so.  i stole a car and they chased me.  i hit a tree.
sentimental fellow, aren't you?
she didn't know he was a criminal. they had a relationship. they --
no...
i must know more of you, my son.
yes.
you black?
truth is, i'm a little nervous.
no.
oh, she older than that.
to set yourself a puzzle you won't ever solve. you know how many towns, how many		    * guys called james g? or john g? shit, leonard, i'm a john g.
they've got me. different thing.
:his mother, with her head thrown back, her eyes aglitter and laughing.
...we actually, we were unaware for several days that this had happened. when they came for his things, it was made known for us, you see?
frank, i don't want to hear it.
just a little something of my own.
i'm not going to quit now....
be very careful with hannibal lecter. dr. chilton at the asylum will go over the physical procedures used with him. do not deviate from them, for any reason. you tell him nothing personal, starling. believe me, you don't want hannibal lecter inside your head... just do your job, but never forget what he is.
it's crazy, but i don't really know, i mean i haven't written anything but "misery" for so long that--you read it you can tell me what you think it's about. maybe you can come up with a title.
okay.
anarchy, my friend. fuck 'em. you know what i mean?
he loves you the way you are.
i see your point. what's the favor?
killing wildlife not good enough anymore, so you go on to bigger and better things.
good day, mr. merrick.
yes.  i hated her for coming between my mother and father.  she kept me from seeing my father.  i went down there to ask her where he was.  she wouldn't tell me, and i shot her.
take charge of him. get him a suite at the imperial and hire some bodyguards.
and what did he say?
you're going to stay in school. do you understand?
that's right... take one of these.
were you thinking of personally driving me back east?
please, jimmy.
it's hit us all hard!
why'd i get involved with this fuckin' nut in the first place? get out!
the plan is... you go.
if we would walk out so soon, it would only call attention to us. perhaps ugarte's in some other part of the cafe.
no! what gave you that idea?
valentine peel. i see you've gone back to using your original face.
"drink with your brain." that's our motto. who are you calling for?
oh well -- you've got to do them.
beautiful girls?
what did they do to you?  tell me!
okay.
if i knew you any better i'd say that doesn't sound like you.
because i took some sleeping pills. but i'm all right now -- so let's go.
roger in op/ed.
quantum is up thirty-five.
you didn't have to.........
hope you enjoy it.
we have a situation. the members are assembling.
he said to follow him.
it's a long shot.
i don't see anything.
aye.  black baron's mischief.
but it's not a year from now, is it?
yeah, me and jake will be heading out for california soon.
i'm not leaving you.
i remember maggie...and your dad too, you know we used to all pile into his old 54 ford pickup. &quot;chuck the truck&quot; we used to call it.
this ice will break yet.  how's our guest?
oh?
what did i say?
he is huron and nothing else.  why would he want to murder the girl?
then you're as single as i am.
...what? what did you call me? george... mccord. you're my favorite actor on...
i know where to look.
eh, mickey, it's getting late.
oh... are you... ?
wait wait wait wait wait he gets a second chance, do you see?  and <u>you</u> get a second chance!
aye, for us there is.
i wouldn't say so if i didn't.
kent's been invited to his high-school class reunion.
oh, yeah.
we did.
oh, rupert and carla had a little hassle and went home.
just like that?
well, this thought just struck me. it wasn't too long ago i was washing dishes way the hell somewhere in texas.
oh, she's really enjoying it.  i think. is mac okay?
why did he buy a film of some poor, lost girl getting butchered?
no, please.  i shall be absolutely fine. they pass almásy, who doesn't look up from his book.
that's so sweet, michael. but, really, i've so many things to do.
if they ask you questions, and they probably will ask you questions, would you please say something nice about him mum? help him?
it wasn't me. it was him.
what's he saying?
what is our target in time?
i just want to listen.
claude.
say, all this john doe business is batty, if yuh ask me.
i think...
married.
no.
it's an american boy's rupture you're supposed to close.
no problem.
normal. average.
hey chief. bring my cup back.
how come i'm still in black and white?
have you guys seen jeffrey?  the limo never showed, i thought he might be here.
is that right?  i'd like a word with him.
two wavy lines?
very well. for twenty-four hours we'll agree that this conversation did not take place.
goodnight!
the fuck did you do that for?!
wait a minute!  what'd i do?
i don't know much about him.
but she loves you?
there are no answers. there's either jason bourne alive or jason bourne dead. and i for one would prefer the latter. and what about her?  you just send her out to this lunatic with no protection?
everything is everything.
saying goodbye in their own way -- in outlawed tartans, with outlawed pipes, playing outlawed tunes.
he escaped.  he's going back in.
i need your help.
i didn't ask him to come!  it's like i said, thelma, he just loves the chase.
i was praying.
preacher! go on down and get me some bourbon. j. t. s. brown. no ice, no glass.
aye, sir.
just cause he didn't want to look at the photos doesn't mean he isn't the doer. not everyone fits the profile.
i got money.
our little toy. you usually have it up and running by now.
like most editors, he really wants to be a writer, but he's too busy living a novel to bother writing one.
nothing will happen! i make the rules as i go!! cubs do what i say! always have! always will! i got cathedral and i'll never let go!
i didn't find out about this very important staff meeting until...
from leon!... how is he?... come, tell us... open it... tell us... how is he?
clean though, isn't he?
no!  absolutely not. don't tell me anything.
get going. you don't want to be late.
that's not us.
this ellingson security creep. i gave him a copy of the disc you gave me.
and a beautiful house it is too. yours is a good life, isn't it?
well then the people you need to call are the police.
right there -
me. hit me!
it's been a while.  maybe i'm just out of practice.
you never spoke so well of him.
yes! he's about to blow the whole machine to smithereens--and *you with it*, mr. governor!
it will. starting with your own.
i just wanted to, i don't know, not exactly apologize for the other night -- especially since i don't remember much of it --
it was lying where on the balcony?
this really isn't a good time.
i would like to be your boyfriend, yes.
i don't know. but it seems to me you must have gone to a lot of trouble to find out who i was, and where i lived and...
and i'm a huge fan of what you did to save that woman, brian.
suave. goddam are you suave, you fucker. you want some beer?
probably the bartender. he wanted to stomp you for what you said to the waitress.
he is an abomination!
i wish i had the nerve. and the figure.
well, that just happened that time.
wherever he wanted to be.
don't even tell me you're hot for miss titty pom poms over there.
you assumed wrong.
janine, i'm sure a woman with your qualifications would have no trouble finding a top flight job in the housekeeping or food service industry.
and...
like riding a bike.
mmm, what?
yes.  well... yes.
but where?
why, brad?
so what's happening with your book?
can i come in?
it's as simple as that?
three kids.  what's she going to do?
lieutentant zogg, how would you like your black butt slung into a general court martial when we get back???
well... everything.  it started coming back a couple of days ago. i remember everything now.
sustained.  your archeological theories have no bearing on the disposition of this creature.
oh, don't blow everything out of proportion.
uh... butt-snatch...
but it was you that gave nancy her strength.  so to get out he has to come through you.  and it's inevitable that he'll hit you at your most vulnerable points...
i had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month.  do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt, and try to fucking return it?
if he don't know, nobody knows. told you it was eight.
i dunno... your wife surviving the assault... her not believing about your condition... the doubt tearing her up inside.., the insulin -
sorry.  it was my father's.  it's temperamental.
maureen?
i don't blame you, earl.  if i were in your place i wouldn't trust anybody, either.
we're not outta here yet.
this swat guy might be a good idea. he may be able to take a little pressure off you. i worry about you.
yeah, well -- good help is hard to find.
a stereo type alarm system?
of course, she's in on it too. don't let her see you. just go get that chest and show the world what collins has been doing. i'm staying here.
unless what?
gee, that was so poetic, jack.  i'm all moist.
i'm still on course to victoria. nobody saw you get on board, nobody seen you since.
yeah, but didn't you love vanessa when you married her? if you love someone once, you can love them again, i know it. my friend leah has gone out with the same guy, like, four times. you're just not trying.
tomorrow we meet at city hall at ten-  - and you're going to be on time.
oh, shit.
yes.
show me.
yeah, in this book there's a chapter called self made freaks about how people would mutilate themselves in order to work in a freak show. it mostly talks about tattooed people and wild men of borneo and shit like that, but there is one mention of a single case where a woman was suspected of having her arms removed on purpose to become an arm-less wonder.
i don't communicate very well through a shroud.
me too.
yeah, where's your urge to purge?
i would have been laughed right out of xenia.
but new struck cuz.
a son is a poor substitute for a lover. 
have some cigars.
i can't... make it... podner.
i don't own this place. the man who does stuck me with kelly.
not listening !
you may be right -  i sometimes wonder - but you get into the habit -
no, that'd be a good story, but that was just the beginning of the end. we went on for another year or so.
warm them up.
he was that good?
all right, that's enough.  you're just a child and wouldn't understand it, but that type of thing can stir a girl up. now lie back and we'll talk.
only one tooth?
okay, sonny.
it's not that kind of date.
good. then pour the wine.
maybe it's something you did in this life, nikko...
is it safe?
the whole disapproval thing.  if you allow yourself to get into a situation where someone else's potential disapproval becomes the focal point of your life -- then you're back to a life of fear, aren't you?  -- you're a prisoner to that again, and that isn't much of a life.
a dress you wear in the evening.
i don't want your money.
i'm sorry, i didn't know.
two million - - great.  that would help.  oh good, that'll take no time.
because he is so deeply hated by so many people in the business.
i remember i had a 1964 buick opal. worst car ever built. value job. everything broke and i-fixed it. a coma car - built to german specs. plastic gas line. 3 speedometer head. on a quiet night, you could hear it rusting in the garage. but when that car was gone, i missed it. if it came driving back in here right now, there'd be tears and laughter ...
from a rich old man who used to be my lover.
she saw through me.
i used to go hunting with my father when i was a kid.
yes!
when does this conference start?
fine.
wrong.
sure.
aye.
what a headstrong fellow! well -- i guess you're quite prepared to suffer the consequences.
he thought he could take my place. it is now my privilege to give an unambiguous account of why i don't think he's man enough to do that.
elizabeth. my more than sister.
foxy. . . foxy. . . you know you're a cute little heartbreaker... foxy... you know you're a sweet little love maker...
so, i'm done. thats it for today?
quick, everyone to the lab.
two or three days! while lyssa is in their hands?
sometimes she can be quite careless. why don't you try mrs. redi?
it's for you.
no kidding?
to fame.. salud..
yeah, but it sucks for free.
a rope!
listen to me i --
not yet.
i go to school, don't i?
you're hurting my head.
you should already know that.  watch the movie, donnie. i have something to show you.
don't you want nice stuff?
it's always the same ... if i've said it once.
no. please, dorothy. why are you in so much trouble?
your bed?
now that's scary!
oh shit!!!
and what do you think mendez?
jesus christ!
i believe so.
i think it was a little more complicated than --
gigi, huh?  sounds french--one of those fancy ladies.  must have been very fancy, if he scratched her phone number in gold.
i know all that.
maybe.
'cause you needed it. 'cause you couldn't hear me without it.
the germans are dropping men on bomb sites.
oh ma, they're not using me. it's just a chance to travel, see things. besides, it's the only way i can get to new york.
so?
i know.
john said you're amish.
we're not going that route.  sonrisa's not someone you make deals with.
yeah, if you've slept.
no, sir...
it's an honor to receive you. mr. president.
but, wally, the window of the <u>firehut</u>...
you got that right.
good. you've both been working close to the front.
what about you?  can you stand a toss?
you won't get any water and you won't get any rest. you may as well drink.
red, i --
d.c.'s very high on giving you the promotion.  there's just one problem.
what happened?  did you lose your keys?
oh, i like it. i like it very much.
i hope so.
oh, you know the bay area!  always foggy!
he hates me.
what?
i will not.
yes, sir...
thanks, yes, i think we did.
place the checks properly. that's the way you do it.
um... well, put it this way... i feel very low in myself. i can't see much in the future, and i feel that any second something terrible is going to happen to me. he pitches forward, face into the plate of spaghetti.
no, they're having a meeting, melanie. your sparrow is standing on a soap box and...
you mean out of business.  heh, heh.
they've broken their pattern.
i'm all right.
back up. go out the other way.
it reminded me of my dog callie.
i have no idea.  her maid said she left two days ago, to meet me -- i can imagine where she is.  but when she finally does come home, she will find her things in the street and my door locked.
who needs gus?
von der null?
at the muncie college of business administration.
i don't want to take 'em out.  just want to keep 'em interested.
are you kidding, it looks great. you wear this to a business meeting, you're the badass in the room. but you can go out dancing in this too. it's a total power suit.
what medicine?
war.
there are only two other alternatives for him.
hi.
nowt.
what two policemen?
he left this morning. he couldn't say where.
shit.  you couldn't be in much worse shape.
good night walter.
no, not me.
who?
the usual motivation doesn't apply to him, nor the way he uses them.  i don't have an answer for you.  listen to me, my friend: leave this.
hello.
i can't remember much after the chinese food that looked like maggots.
what makes sammy run?
i'm glad you like it.  now be quiet, i've really got to read these.
it was.  i couldn't have you go away, wherever it is...to war...without knowing something.  you think i made a choice, of danny over you.  i didn't.  i didn't have a choice.  i'm pregnant.
position, bird of prey?
she had white shoes.
it is the fortress of krull. i know it only from the stories of wars on other worlds. they did not use it on our world in the first great war, for it costs them enormous power. this time they mean to conquer, at all costs.
there's something very dangerous about her. something evil...
you came to take my wife from me?
i'm sorry.
darling susan.
tch, no!  we were, we were both going in different directions.
...i made a detailed physical examination of the patient, sir, yesterday evening, i...
who's up for a night on the town.
son of a bitch. they knew each other.
hang on, you ain't heard the best part!  abc has seen your foreign man character, and they want to turn him into --  "latka," a lovable, goofy mechanic!!!
shhh! albert's gonna hump the coup de ville.
you broke up with my machine?
that's right.
of course there is, jack. what do you think the crusades were - a frat initiation? i don't think so...there has to be a grail.
you don't know me. what, you've known me, two, three months. what do you know?
what did you see?  the same as i. appetite sated.  desire indulged.  you saw the working of the world in miniature.
you live in miami?
i just think it's too early to paint. that's my opinion.
... looks like a convention.
not my problem.
yeah......yeah.....
you didn't do so well yourself. finding that stone could've gotten you all the fortune and glory you were talking about.
does anybody?
i mean it, let's get away from here, first joey then nolan, now charley— and any minute... .  ...i'm frightened— i'm frightened.
oh, yeah? is the frame holding?
with, like, images?
during the farpoint mission. we were on the bridge and you told a joke. that was the punchline.
whatever. just hurry.
hey santa, where are you? everybody’s here.
mais non, c'est pour toi.
what do they do?
in the play. she was married, by my age. and mummy. mummy wasn't much older than me when she got married. well, not <i>that</i> much older.
you got one?
you're kidding.
anything for a dear friend.
shaking hands. well, that's not saying much for my wife, is it?
you're a cop - you'll never believe me.
you are neither, claudia. now stop this --
i heard you.
if another ship had been beneath us the klingons would've seen her!
my nails.
i guess that makes you the smart one.
shut up, king jay ..
tonight?
well not especially. it can be in turkish, if you really want. i don't care.
uzi?
they'll be here.  don't worry.  my men are picking them up.
probably best. you may want to shoot yourself half way to ohio.
see? there you go again.
she's really getting to you, isn't she?
i'm not scared, mrs. robinson.
see if there's another label underneath.
but what about all these other people?
i can not allow the fortune in slaves my first husband created and what our partnership has elevated, to be destroyed...
sad? what made you sad?
i want to get high off this; bateman, not sprinkle it on my fucking all-bran.
we'll get those answers when you find the one you're looking for.
there was a young fellow over at jamilla's today when it got hit.  way she tells it he got whacked around good by one of the robbers.
well, i should be in florida now! if carl hadn't gone in to get those stones removed, you wouldn't be here and i'd be on my way to the keys. on my boat, relaxing with a glass of port!! re-ti red!
i don't know!
yeah, but don't pick me up. my father may think it's strange. i'll walk over to your house. i'll be there at eight o'clock.
i just... would like to say a few words... about merle. i guess merle always wanted something... i don't know... better. that fucking guy, he saved my life. he saved sal's... what merle liked, he liked things right... but then there wasn't any place for that... that he could find.
so. you talked to mundt, what about?
then i can't be hurt anymore.
bullshit!
not at all.
that's a ridiculous move.
i'm sure we can locate it for you, sir.
no.  smashing is not required.  i have a surprise for our tiny invaders... raise that hatch!
not exactly.
so i came to new york and moved in with my sister and her husband -- he drives a cab. they sent me to secretarial school, and i applied for a job with consolidated - but i flunked the typing test --
a little to the left...
i get the point, kiddo. but i'm not so bad, am i?
thank you. i've had all the calories necessary for today.
that you were just indulging me.
not at all.  i was in the foxholes myself.
listen to me.
have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
an occupational hazard, i'm afraid.
yes  siree -- that's the idea. get them all here and then say: "look, folks -- here's daniel webster, my guest of honor." golly, i can see their eyes pop already.
let's watch some tv.
he's the one that's made every ingenue in stock!
i need two tactical assault squads at place denfert immediately. you can tell the commissioner it's a code red.
why did you tell me you did, then?
it's not what it looks like, vanessa.  at ease, boys.
it's hell week. chill. the movie murders have brought out the crazies. it's nothing.
for your own sake... for the others... i...
your government always been pretty happy to have that line. the question's just been where to draw it
agnes...
hey, where's claude? i don't see claude!
he believes in the future --
i'll tell you, then. the last time this music was played on these air waves was after they announced that your pal hitler had shot himself. listen to it.  they listen. did they pick little k's recording? did they pick some other conductor? no, they picked you, and why? because you represented them so beautifully. when the devil died, they wanted his bandleader to conduct the funeral march. you were everything to them.
sorry, mrs. chambers. i hate bothering you...
yeah, for the last time, i hope.  i'm done with this freak show.  i'm moving back to the real world.
a dozen?  i got half of 'em elected. i still got the south and goldwater and his boys.  i'll take my chances with the senate.
-- hey, i got a better chance of being hit by a bus then moving up.
the most. you ever lost. on a coin toss.
sounds like you ve never seen her, eddie.
no.
oh, yeah. real well. still do.
blondes are discriminated against worldwide! brooke's a blonde, and people are saying she's sleeping with the cheesy pool boy and shooting her husband. if she was a mousy brunette, it would be, "oh, the poor widow."
he won't see us... we'll just stalk him from a distance.
i'm in town on a case.  dropped by to see vince and we thought we'd see the new display.
yeah, dave walters.
my usual place.  on the right side. the first seat.
that's not even --
okay, this is working.
i didn't mean -
what about the others?
did he tell you about my party?
do you now, mr. watson?
it can wait.  anything else?
i've been a bad boy.
as long as people think jesse's still riding, we will never get the respect we deserve.
yeah, but you didn't have the scudster working on it, did you?
what about back home?
i'm surprised to see you.  i thought you'd be halfway to vegas by now.
look, you don't fuck with me, i don't fuck with you, right?
um... that's very relaxing.
dr. woodly?  you know who this is?
ready. any time you are.
charles...
that goddamn neanderthal? i'm the one who gave him the idea for the combination bug spray-sun screen! did you know that?!
if anyone asks about simone --
you want another one of these, too?
i don't know.
yes.  they were there... so, it must be.
they said he's a drug dealer.
am i too heavy for you?
overruled...
anything. anything at all.
the guy was history when he killed kelly.  you knew that.
i did not accept any.  i...  i wanted... to.  but i didn't. you know i didn't.  don't you?
but why would she -- ?
all y'got to do is <u>ask</u>... 
really.  well, that makes two of us.
colon!
people actually used to pay you for this?
okay, good tip.
hey!
you sound like the tourists. know-it-alls who read about survival in a magazine.  fuck you.  you won't make it off this mountain.
that's what i gotta tell you. she bugged me the whole time. got pissy with me 'cause i wouldn't let her carry the bag. started running her fuckin' mouth... i couldn't remember right away when we came out where the car was parked, so she got on me about that. "is it this aisle lou- is, is it that one?" she was totally fuckin' with my nerves.
that's why we're here, sheriff cable. where's the body?
truth is i usually get along better with animals than with people. in nepal the villagers call me 'kin-tan- tee', which means 'man who is loved by many animals...  ...who love him a lot, too... and so on.'
you won't get another chance at this, admiral.
you got to get up from here, girl.
what is up with that weirdo?
ouch!
sure. of course.
what's to stop you? saunders will help you with it--
well, well, sure... because he's a singer and you're a singer, you know, so it's perfect. so you're trying to suffocate yourself. it-it makes perfect sense. uh, uh, that's a perfect analytic... kind of insight.
the first time i've been grateful for coit tower.
whata you mean i've got no choice?
i've never dealt in black-jacks. never.  everybody knows that.
once the subject was polymerized we were unable to reassemble the original organic structure.
and yourself too in the process. god, you're so beautiful. why couldn't i see that before?
yes, cherie, of course you want more. and i'll show you how to get it. you drink from morals, my beauty, but from me? never again.
a little birdie whispered in my ear today... about the needle-candy you're chasing.  it's up here...  ... in the old curiosity shop.
depends on how much shielding is between us and the reactor.
don't take it personally.
i don't know.
are you going to let us pass -- or do i have to call the sheriff?
and did you lose her? did she go?
i want to see stew smith. oh excuse me - i mean mr. smith.
it will be okay.
you invented this, this...
what do you mean 'stole'? i didn't steal anything from you.
i know my behavior is...erratic sometimes.
that was a long time ago.
later.
the biggest. the biggest movie you've ever dealt with, lee. we're talkin' a lot of film. a man'd have ta be an idiot not to be a little cautious about a movie like that. and lee, you're no idiot.
it's garbage.
detective hugo, it's a simple case of lost and found.  all we have to do is locate the man who's minus an eyelash and this murder will solve itself.
huh?
and i'm your friend —— but that doesn't explain why you are always trying to come between thea and me?
he was throwing snowballs at baron rothschild.  we don't know each other, do we?
what is going on?
a man... under stands one day... that his life is built on nothing. and that's a bad, crazy day.
no, we can handle this.
can't do it.
yeah, right, publicist.
mr. concannon...?
right away.
you sure seen a lot for a blind man.
i'll be in my office.
i don't know.
i'm not sure where i can talk anymore.
it's not only financial assistance. what he's got to do is go to baltimore tomorrow and ask his parents for money. it's not going to happen on the phone.
could you tell us about being made a prussian privy councillor. how did that happen to a non-party member?
not now, harold...  you can't put me down for monday?
i was speaking of earth men. i meant the greatest philosopher -- the greatest thinker.
i asked you to be nice to him.
my family found this baby in the river, high aldwin.
i was a mentor to her.
what was that?
minus one.
i might have his number on campus.
our lives are more important. anyway, we can take a small amount of the most valuable stuff with us on the lifeboat.
you have the right to say "no." and i have the right to make you wait here with ray while i go get a warrant. and if i don't want to go through all that trouble, i could just take you in on suspicion.
it's a soporific.
yeah.
ah fuck it.
have you ever retired a human by mistake?
no, it's logical if you think like your father. see, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else.
no. my mother's dead.  you goin' back inside?
it grows on you.
now there you are completely wrong. if we sit down for a little chat, i'm sure we won't run out of conversation and what's more it won't be dull.
yes, that would be great. are you her for the convention?
yes, addison.
you were incompetent! - whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink this court will determine.
not here!  they can see.
somebody...
crank her!
i'm not goin' anywhere, eric. i live here.
what choice?
the failures they remember.  it's the successes they forget.
your what?
she's a women, and that's why you're ridin' her bareback.
see if you've been making it with my mother.
so?
... and your prerogative is to find her guilty...
probably. she's on the phone twenty- three hours a day.
he don't look wise.
it's mine.
we have!  trying to track you down.  the phone there is disconnected.
sure honey, what's the hurry?
i promise, dorothy. i promise.
ssssh!
it's the most beautiful place in the universe.
key? key? what is the key?
yes, you do!  you are still my disciple.
the fire's got the temperature way up all over camp... won't last long though.
campari and soda would do nicely.
i don't know.
him?
i should release corbett because you want some votes?
this is where the stories are. you are going to become friends with these people. you are going to party with them. you are going to hang out with them on weekends. when they go to prom, you are going to be in their same damn limo!
you haven't even driven a car since you took office.
you need healthy, natural sleep. chew valerian root and get some more exercise.
and sid says you stole it!
yes sir.
of course, how stupid of me. a quarter to seven, will that be all right?
hey!  hey!  andy's ice cream.
you are a multi-media magnate. the tycoon of tits. the baron of bottoms.
oh, no, listen, i don't want to take up too much of your time.
so that's what a lion looks like. 
you crawler.
it'll just be a few minutes.
i won't eat cheese for no cops, that's for sure.
he's having a heart attack or something.
we've got to move fast. this is an idea whose time has come.
for once in your life think about what's best for troy. who has to beg for money to buy him medicine when you screw up? who?
you carryin' a firearm, son?  don't lie to me now.
don't taste bad.
here's another tip...
things change. anyway, you gave up your claim to that love the first time you stuck your dick in maxine.
yeah, rock particles.  dust.
annette! annette!
your people.
that place is four hundred dollars a month?
you give me a pain!
fine.
no!
pretty girl, about this girl's height- dark hair-gorgeous body?
yeah, nice meetin' you.
don't say that.
fun?  say, listen, i'll take you on a bender that will live in your memory as a thing of beauty and joy forever.  boy! boy! my headpiece!
that's great. i haven't sung around a campfire since i was a boy in iowa. what are we going to sing? what... bones, what are we going to sing?
i am the man who might save your life -- give you a bit more life at any rate.  i am proximo palindromos head of this gladiatorial school which is named after me.  i own this school and everything that's in it.  you're in it!  but why?  what did a roman general do to get himself condemned to the colosseum? understand, we usually get corn thieves and pick pockets.  please, i separated you from the others because...  ... my nose tells me you've been condemned for important reasons.
what'd i tell you?
didn't they tell you? that hitcher was just about to cut your throat when you stopped to take a leak. you got a fucking horseshoe up your ass, man.
but you saw it here.
sometimes 76 or 80. sometimes i squeeze a few more hours in the morning. eighty miles a day, a hundred miles a night.
why me?  why don't <u>you</u> do it?
why else would you send off for me? if you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute.
ok.
yes, i know who he is.
yeah.
don't concern yourself, martin. this boy needs treatment.  we're taking care of it.  sorry for the disturbance.
i'm a banker, friend.  that's legit in this state.
the guy died.
that'll be all, boys.
can you go there with us now? me and karl. we could just hang out. karl has some cool books.
sun glasses?
can i go too?
yes.  dolores...and even your mom and dad.  but i'll make sure you go last.
come with me.
i sense injuries.  the data could be called pain.
he wanted more than that.
i won't forget this.
you was our first supreme commander, terry. keep out of sight and i'll tell him you're out.
because you're leaning?  no, you're just on an angle.  you're too heavy!
what's the question mark?
say the words, "i understand."
sir august merryweather? i was looking for something relaxing. say, a tuscan hillside in june?
you've got to pick three more numbers.
oooo... big fucking scary guy. just put $120,000 on tomorrow's game.
what was i going to do with them? i only smoke cigars.
the only thing left for them is the city grid...  ...they may not do it.
rose, please go away.
it's what i deserve.
yep...  yes...  it is.
you're not paid to be a canary.
why not?
oh, okay, forgive me.  your neighbors are here, for fuck's sake.
well the thing is your room is right next door to ours, and so we thought, well, i thought, if you were willing we might move you to grammoo's room, and use your old room for the nursery. see we're gonna be up half the night with a newborn and there'll be a lot of noise....
we got it. we got it.
because, you know why. you know.
yes. now. find her. she's somewhere in the building --
interesting theory. where's the proof?
it'll remind me of you.
my guards are from south africa, mr. bond. this is their chance to get even with the formerly 'great' britain.  now both of you. put your hands on your heads, and step forward.
so you see, i'm not going anywhere.  unless it's upstairs with you ...
tomorrow is sunday.  nobody's doing business.  crack of dawn, monday, walter'll take you up there...
so isn’t it time you unwrapped your present?
he had the detonators!  theo?  theo!
that's right.
if it looks old, it's worth money, simple. so stop fucking moaning and rob the place.
yes?
take it down to the bomb squad, artie-
no argument there.
don't you want to make one?
everybody ... move!!
put your guns on the table...  if we wanted you dead, you would no longer be drawing breath in miami. we wouldn't have brought you all the way here.
right, slow...
toxic dumps, huh.
maintenance.
fuck you, i did the body work. whose fuckin' router you think sanded out all that bondo?
please, you're just as ambitious as i am, more --
yeah, well, monkey or not i'm still editor of this rag. amy, i thought you were doing that piece on the f.b.i. -- j. edgar hoover: when will he marry?
no, not okay.  i thought we had a good thing going here.  it shows you never know.
oh, they're still here.  they're just not showing up.
thank you.
okay.
--it must wait, child. these good ladies, for whom i intervened once, will honor me with a meal. i am beholden to them now as i was when they begged my protection.
where is he?
miss walker -- i didn't expect anyone ——
give me a date, doctor.
this charnier guy.  he's in shipping?
is this where you live?
woman, have you lost your mind? what's the matter with you?
we better get an orthopedic man in here. is dr. davis on call?
oh gawd, oh yes, it's never been better. never better!!
with a wrecking ball.  you want to help me swing it?
what if i told you your patients are in real physical danger from their dreams?
the one in brentwood.
i believe he believes him.
what?
really?  and what game did you want to play?  you carry my box for me, and i fall into bed with you?
well, as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection, while at the same time experimenting with mind-expanding drugs in a consequence-free environment, i'll be sound as a pound.
i didn't know you had one.
i don't know, brian... i don't know...
yeah... i saw that girl come on to you at the tv show.
maybe if we gave the tapes back --
thanks, quince.
plain-clothes man.  come on, slaves, drink and be merry for tomorrow you might be appointed correspondent to washington ... a fate worse than death.
...the guy's great.
what dead one on the ship?
you know my friend maureen? her son, the investment banker? he paid for her entire retirement in boca raton. what a mench he is. instead of schleping to save hanukkah, god forbid you should go back to business school and get an mba. maybe then you could send me to boca, too.
who do you know who can? where do we go?
i don't know, i just thought it was interesting.
oh, adam.  we're home.  in our own house.  nonsense.  i'll make some coffee.  you get some more firewood.
wouldn't want that...  okay -- just one more.
it's your problem.
looks okay. i don't see anything.
that's a fact.
so you say. nice to meet you; hope you're intelligent. like these, how'd you get these? 
i know.
i'd work backstage or something?
i don't understand what the--
your majesty --
more money... like i'm shocked to hear you say that.
stop pestering me then!
you're a comfort to me, henry.
i will.
'cause i'm worried, did you just break up with me?
...thanks.
harmful, like -- how?  what would you get?
it was meatloaf. you just put everything in your soup.
then c'mon.  follow me.  the art's in the basement, you're going to get a privileged peek.
of course, mr. parrish.  right away.
he's doing the interview with the lady --
that's right and now that you're no longer a virgin. you gotta die -- those are the rules.
come in, boy -- come in.
well ... go 'head, do the next bit.
because i'm alienated.
and what is your profession?
i don't want to go to lunch.
can i ask you, can i trust to leave my keys with you and give them to you so that when they get here you could give them to them? barry ok.
everything okay?
dumbshit.
the kid is amazing.
razor and blade.
i think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone. especially king’s daughter.
i hardly think a few birds are going to bring about the end of the world.
i tried.
samo.
nobody said... norman...  what?  why are you looking at me like that?
to the twins' soiree?  so they can paw you and drool...?
no. not very big.
it don't look together.
as long as there's room for three in it.  what, didn't you bring your new friends?
luke blew it up. give credit where it's due.
not now, but maybe later, if they like the program.
horsefeathers!
yeah, beautifully fucking illustrated.
jerk! you idiot!!!
no.
we haven't got a spare place.
why not?
yes?
you'd better before you catch the disease!
interrogation's over, bedsoe.
try it -- you may have more influence than you think.
and diego?
they're going to send detectives.
when time seemed to stop... and you could almost live in that moment...
i don't understand.
perhaps the machine's on the blink! it keeps picking up old films. that can't he right, can it?
case...
home?
read me what she said.
why?
where's your car, dude?
sure we believe you, only now we want you to believe us.  that car better be back here by noon tomorrow, or there's going to be fireworks.
pretty close?
what difference does it make?
fuck you, i'm gone!
seven years.
once it's spent you won't have to worry about it.
cigarettes, candy bars...  pcp, crack...
and what we believe is what's accepted as "truth" now, isn't it, owen?  psychiatry -- it's the latest religion.  and we're the priests -- we decide what's right and what's wrong --we decide who's crazy and who isn't. ... i'm in trouble, owen.  i'm losing my faith.
what?  what was that?  something funny, miss swann? share, please.
watch and see, a day or a week - but certainly this month -- you will have money from a man and then-
i was down in adamant...
i don't know about that plantation angle.
yes.
every time i look at you, i wanna hit...
go back and tell dr. neilsen. have him report to the skipper.
an f.b.i. agent came by the bar. he left me his c-c, he left me his c-c, he left me this.
i'm sorry.  which hospital?
i can keep a victim alive for weeks... months, if i desire it... it's an art.  they beg for death... i keep it just out of their reach.  the pain remains constant.
there, there. don't you upset yourself --
leeches. a long list of leeches.  it looks good like that.
three months, bull. three months tonight. three months since the accident - and i'm no closer to going home than i was then.
so?
and it's all flowing toward the museum.
he said he wasn't coming back. he said it wasn't working for him any more. that it hadn't "worked for him" for quite a while... you know what i regret the most? i'm sorry i let him make the kids take his name. he was an acquirer.  he liked to acquire things.
i've heard this argument before.  it's not happening.
roger.
don't be silly.  what are you sorry about?
all he could think about was getting to you. there's still love there i think.
you don't just dismiss bill weir. the man held oppenheimer's chair at princeton. if the event horizon had worked, he would have gone down in history as the greatest mind in physics since einstein.
nine hundred meters and dropping. 800.  700.  hang on gentlemen.
that means it's good.
what ain't there?
this date -- is it just a date -- or is it something serious?
where is he sir?  right in front of me.  what's he doing?  he's on the= phone.  i don't fucking know, his stockbroker! oh shit.  gotta go.
but of course.
don't call me ever again.
a surprise huh?  well i don't like any surprises, especially if i'm forking over the loot for them!
yeah...i mean...well...i don't know, really, sir.
follow me.
i gave you life. and they can't take it away from you. remember that. you'll get outta here someday. i believe that. you gotta believe it, too.
he's right here in the...
you're welcome to one of these, whatever they are.
what are you talking about?
i -
you mock us with a smile?
what is it now?
a dozen times.
get in the car.
you know you've got nothing but cars down there in impound.
jeez, for a guy with a ton of clocks, you sure don't pay much attention to time.
that's something i suppose.
she asked about you, madmartigan.
oh no! one hears such sounds and what can one say, but - salieri!
well enrique is great and...we are the best.
that's what we're paid for.
then what?
sure, sheriff.
some people got faces that stick in your mind.
you're not going to use that gun, johnny.
you're the spawn of satan. you got it in you.
yeah. you?
i'm doing good, good. you look great. did you lose some weight?
chat jargon for moving from fantasy to real victims: "i went live last month."
i can't make the tenth.
i don't understand.
substance abuse?
not a discrepancy, an error. my capacity is 5.5 tons, not 6.
ciao.
might be...
and i never will- you know what's between us — we're a thing but this is serious competition.
he'd call it habit. but now... i get the feeling he's going through the motions a bit.
i know, i did, but damnit howard--  for the first time since i've known him, i think he's really humping...
i guess that's a no.
we got a call earlier on three negro youths.  firing shotguns in griffith park from a late-model purple mercury coupe.
tht was summation, your h...
yeah, i picked it up.
is that the logical thing to do, spock...?
those mud puddles were certainly a waste of money.
thea?
the world isn't going to end, you dummy; i hope you know that much.  but it is going to change. it's going to change drastically, and probably in your lifetime. the clock people see calamitous earthquakes as the agent of change, and they may be right, since there are a hundred thousand earthquakes a year and major ones are long overdue. but there are far worse catastrophes coming... unless the human race can bring itself to abandon the goals and values of civilization, in other words, unless it can break the consumption habit -- and we are so conditioned to consuming as a way of life that for most of us life would have no meaning without the yearnings and rewards of progressive consumption. it isn't merely that our bad habits will cause global catastrophes, but that our operative political-economic philosophies have us in such a blind crab grip that they prevent us from preparing for the natural disasters that are not our fault. so the apocalyptic shit is going to hit the fan, all right, but there'll be some of us it'll miss. little pockets of humanity. like the clock people. like you two honeys, if you decide to accept my offer of a lease on siwash cave. there's almost no worldwide calamity -- famine, nuclear accident, plague, weather warfare or reduction of the ozone shield -- that you couldn't survive in that cave.
- something about an old road ending and a new one starting - paved with stars...
as long as you keep overpaying me, i'll be the first to go into production on three, and four, as well.
and you can only do it once, right?
what lecture could be more important than the will of baron beaufort frankenstein?
what you're seeing is a computer driven image created by photons and forcefields...
what ... i..have... to do.
nothing doing. this is my percentage. you birds are going to get yours. and anyhow, i found this dump.
yes, yes, i did.
destroy his credibility before he goes public. neutralize him. i don't want anyone listening to a word he has to say. tell me about rachel banks.
i said drown 'em all! who is that?
i can appreciate that.
we had hounds down at the scene, the footprint trail was a bust. and there were no other tire tracks in the vicinity.
you're not far wrong.
i can't do that.
it was accurate, but i can't get a fuller listing for you--all barker's phone records have been subpoenaed.
shit, dude, i didn't know.  i wouldn't've done it if i knew he was a fucking crybaby.
what's your story, baby?
...am i a good man or am i a bad man?
watch me.
mmmnkay.
and he took a swing at you?
some money.
... brom bones...
do what? i haven't done a thing.
on the chiffonier.  here.
now you just turn this way and go right straight down.
sit down, benjamin.
make up your mind, kid, i beg you, before we get to four thirty-seven river... .
you don't need to be helped any longer. you've always had the power to go back to kansas.
clear on starboard -- where's lance an' the captain?
yes.
beam him out!
hubert's? oh really? it moved uptown, right?
i could hide you, tommy.
not bad, not bad.
you re not thinking of going to...
i can't be late. i don't know if the radio balloons work above your planet. i don't know if my words went to the ship. if i'm not there, the captain will think i'm dead and go.
you're qualified and available. and frankly, i can't spare a real agent right now.
or...  ...she gave it to somebody else first, before melanie went in the dressing room.
what?
i'm not sick.
no, no, no. we've been looking to renovate that area of our hotel for some time now. the security team is only present to preserve floor integrity, due to the roof access.
what's going on?
what's so important?
literally. it's not a bad deal, gentleman. i get peace of mind. you get detective sheilds. but this is the best part, walter... walter, your daughter will get to keep her braces and have that winning smile. capice?
three people: two guys, a girl-- sleeping in the same motel room, the same tent night after night.
no.
yeah, i know, but poultry...?
one moment, i'll be right with you.  in fact, a...one point, which i spoke to you of which  i can't talk to you about here.
are you juno, our case worker?
that's exactly what you are.
no.
but i am a captain.  if i were not a captain, i would thank you for the compliment and tell you that the ability to lie comes from being a top-notch poker player, which i am, having learned at the side of my mother who is, by popular acclaim, the best poker player in...
marvin, i need you to hold on. there's officers positioned and waiting to move in a block away.
i got 'em in the kitchen.  i'm eating her crumb cake.
it's gonna get cold.
they'd have to keep something like this under lock and key in new york, and it would still get fucked up.
where did you plant the c-4?!
buddy, you're just a child.
it's an island, near here, with a lighthouse.  we sometimes hang out there, you know....
i think it's a bad idea.
he came after us. and i told dunbar he had to kill him...
i think he's planning on staying in rome for a few days.
do you get high, sam?
we'll take it.
try four and a half. at first i totally didn't like him.
just.
no.
sure.
it's nothing!
where's mike today?
they did a nice job... cozy, huh?
what is it?
what do you mean, "in no time"?
why?
what?
<u>nothing's</u> real.  i'm rich, people are automatically my friends, sycophants ooze out like oil slicks and and and--
i've had girlfriends, but all they wanted from me was weed and shit.  shit, my grandma used to say, "which is better: a good plate with nothing on it..." no, wait. i fucked up. she said "what's a good-looking plate with nothing on it?"
good evening, dr. lechter.  thank you for coming.  i am sorry that we could not meet under more pleasant circumstances.
i can't hear you.  i can't hear anything.  i'm, i'm, i'm, i'm gonna lose hearing in my ear!  i'm--
too bad.
i'm a water-skier.
when are you going to open your eyes?
are you a physician?
actually, his days of marital infidelity have long since past. now he just shtoops my mother exclusively.
yes.  where are we going, jud?
what is it?
okay, boss!  but i hope you know what you're doing.
you and us.
yeah.
my name is john.  now i'm not a stranger anymore.  see how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?
you don't know the procedure.
red leader standing by.
you're saying... there is no separate primer in the message -- because it's on every page so the recipient can decipher it wherever he is --
mr. zavitz was involved in an extortion scheme. we believe he passed you sensitive materials, possibly with your knowledge, and we need to--
that's just it huey. the pigs don't know how many panthers there are. both of us show and they might start putting 2 and 2 together. we're not even two hundred strong yet... but we got 'em guessing thousands.
just don't chew it.
you know why. it's part of the parole deal.
uh huh. the retail end, i understand.
almost five.
carmine left?
yeah, he's the mafia. linen supply business or cement and contract, you know what i mean?
yeah, problem was, i had the only copy. see ya.
it will all be over in such a little while, jacqueline, and everything will be all right again. drink your coffee.
what do you mean? you mean...  do you think i'm going to flake out on you?
think they're alright?
no more dentists, no more dentists...
no. but now that you mention it, i did talk to a handsome executive at paramount the other day... who just happened to get his hands on the script.
hey, ray.  guess whose name is on the numbered bank account besides yours and sam's?
oh.  no.
oh?  oh!
oral surgery.  corrective teeth surgery.
why?
i agree.
thanks for waking me up.  picking me up. you're loud today.
it's coming.  run.
you promise?
are you crazy!? you know that's totally impractical. besides, like the bible says...  an eye for an eye...
uh, no.  yes.  i mean, just some scrapes...
let's go in.
doctor.
can't...can't you build the old mill?
use some common sense! setting off a fire alarm causes panic...the same kind of panic caused by suggesting jason voorhees is on board.  enough is enough.
it's incredible, honey - the whole thing.  a lieutenant colonel testifies that lee oswald was given a russian language exam as part of his marine training only a few months before he defects to the soviet union.  a russian exam!
me too.
what?
hey, sonny - you did it!
i prefer bourbon.
apollo's a great fighter.
what do you think... you are sixteen years old on hollywood boulevard?
i do?
no.  just as if i'd like to.
is she running treadstone?
mrph mprph!!
if i were... i believe my memory engrams would sense the absence of your specific reactions and behavior. i would "miss you."
the son'a reports claim they didn't fire until after he malfunctioned.
well, let's spit on it.
it's an improvement.
yes, you're right.  it will be done.
rather disappointed at how poorly i taught you proper housekeeping.  and quite well, it seems.  thanks to you, son.  thanks to you all.
i was just...
here.  put this on.  you examine him.
that's the way of the world.
yes.  tell me.
headache -- squire?
enough! you better start talkin' to us, asshole, cause we got shit we need to talk about. we're already freaked out, we need you actin freaky like we need a fuckin' bag on our hip.
you know exactly where they are!
that will never happen.
holy shit, dulli.  what the hell are you doing here?
i was a poet till now, but i have seen beauty that puts my poems at one with the talking ravens at the tower.
none of your business, madam.
is it necessary to know?
hey, fuckball, i don't need your permission. l.a.'s an open city.
we wanted to challenge the notions of classic beauty. we wanted to showcase women throughout the world.
we've got to go now, then.
who?
thing's been workin' on me, what they was yellin' about. got me all curious.
you knew what he was capable of and you just stood by. it was just a matter of time till somebody fragged his ass, and you know what? he deserved it. there's your confession.
hear!
he also said we'd avoid that storm in space. and we know how that turned out.
of course.
what is it?
lead the way.
how could i run it from say -- pakistan?
you're psyched. you need to lay off of that shit.
pacific northwest is a hotbed for serials.
stealing is a sin.
don't go upstairs.
did i tell you?  did you listen to me?  oh no, no, you knew better didn't you?  no, it's just an ordinary rabbit isn't it.  the names you called me.  well, don't say i didn't tell you.
dig.
hello ....  give me ....  well ....  ?
so attack is your defence. well let's hope cetshwayo will offer his impis full destruction.
...of course...
you had disadvantages.
he's good at it.
not really to speak of.
male.
i think you know that.
you don't like her because you were involved with mr. marsh before she came along.  isn't that true?
what assholes.
the mamma's there too.
i can't right now.  i've got a game.
the fences are electrified, right?
mommy... mommy...!
so we on the same page then?
for dinner.  unless i call and tell them we're still in new hampshire.
better than one.
i should go back.  ricky tan mentioned a boat in hong kong harbor...
why do you have to be so bloodthirsty?  do you enjoy it?  all that blood and noise and pain? diplomacy is far more civilized... far safer... and far cheaper...
yes, mr. brett--right away.
i know. but take the-miracle of the loaves and fishes, for example! i think about it a lot...how is it possible for...
yah.
how long will this whole thing take?
got the same problem with my pop -- garlic. nothin' you can do.
they'll be there waiting.
i don't know.....
thanks...
i guess i see the teacup as a symbol for womanhood, because of tea parties in the olden days, but instead of tea i was trying to kind of confront people with this... like...
you know, boss, this happened to geraldo and his career never recovered.
we've not gonna get to the cabin till after dark as it is, thelma.
i have a question for you.
i'll work on it, ma'am.
did i scowl at you?
er, good luck, yes.
you're welcome.
i don't know where to begin...
the government's afraid, and they don't know what to do. but they're more afraid of terrorists than of you. the viceroy has agreed to your release if you will speak for non- violence.
or you ran into something ....
what are you talking about? vegas?
yorgi and kirill.
you like this, don't you. showing me... this.
you then learned where the thieves had hidden the money... and at the instructions of your employer went to retrieve it yourself.
look at you, not even breaking a sweat. you're cool, boy.  you're cool.
what does that mean?
five minutes and fifty seconds.
i'm going to try to remove it.
sid 6.7 isn't grimes.
no, somebody powerful.  oh.  look. what's that up there?
they all like this in your family, father?
he did?
you've... found it.  what could i possibly have that you would want, mr. hadden?
while you were in the shower.
does that mean this whole thing is over?
i understand.
ayuh, only it's early, i need a drink to wake me up.
good night.
thank god...
confused.  i'm not sure what to do now.  i'm not sure what he wants for me.
not me. but other people seem to.
i've been thinking about that since you brought it up before.
...light snack, but good, thanks pal, you're sharking your way up...
what do you think?
lions and tigers and bears!
mine too?
you sing and dance?
just take deep breaths.
i can't give you that. and if you put me on the stand, i'll lie.
did you really ask?
...geez.
you got a letter from mom.
okay, take some executive... bored with his life, bored with his wife... he picks up a hooker or some girl at a bar.  then he goes around for months, torn up worrying that he's got aids, that he'll infect his wife.  and maybe he really does catch something--
yes, i know.
cotton, i've done nothing but help you.
mama...mama she's asleep. why don't you eat something.
to yours.
hi, annie, laurie...
yeah. yeah, i will.
i guess.
calloway, you haven't shown me one shred of evidence.
your lady friend.  the one who gave you her business card.  think she was just being polite?
how much time?
what if--you're vomiting?
donovan's firm is defending a major murder case and his caseload is so heavy he's taking on first year interns.
not good enough.  we still gotta catch big geek.
just do what i say, okay? we'll pay for the girls and have a good time... don't you trust me?
she said something about having to get home to take a call from her mother back east.
what?  ridden on a horse?
what do you mean, julie?
i don't want to take you out of your way.
he won't get mad, huh?
no, that's bad management.
homework assignment.
it's a lot of world for one man.  you sure that's not wishful thinking, you wishing you'd made something more of yourself? christ, truman, who hasn't sat on the john and had an imaginary interview on "seahaven tonight"?  who hasn't wanted to be somebody?
--fuck anna!
oh.
because ... i have to relax.
i don't want to learn that!
but you said toxic.
-- his car. they have it blocked.
no way! he can't!
he said he'd prove it.
all the time...
you can't go back to find your home. your home is in your heart, in the future that you make for yourself.
do you know how you caught me, will?
sometimes. i told you i did.
oh -- okay.
and he invented fire.
doc. i know we're not supposed to get together till wednesday...
thank you, miss boatwright.
yeah.  old times.
gopher, everett?
listen to me -- i can't do anything about what you're going to do. i can't change anything.  i can't stop you.  i just want some information...
what other kind of white powder do people keep in a vial?
don't count it.
so?
the liquors lovely. the rest of the party you can have.
if you're doing all this just for me.
i came to talk to you.
you may as well invite her here.
there's a sand barricade up ahead; i'm going to ram this cab into it. the cab has an airbag, odds are good i'll survive.  but with this steel casing and bullet proof glass, odds for you are not so good.
you expect me to just walk in there?
i hate it when you talk like this.  go on.
do you want me to sleep on it?
i have sincere eyes.
"future" of...?
i work at kentucky fried chicken.
in the middle of the night?
you have to sleep for three.
all right. that's why i sent for you.  there's a room full of reporters out there. i want you to make a statement—that you've had a talk with me—that we've reached an understanding—that if ellen comes home, i won't interfere with your marriage. will you do that?
you really are one dumb asshole.
no, i embrace it... as something to be used or discarded as we advance the boundaries of what is known.
guess, spock. your best guess.
leave it -- i'll wash it for you.
why?  because he had you?
i don't like nobody behind my back!
why is he sitting up like this? he needs rest.
as long as they can use you?
we will if we can and if we can't, we'll come back and ask you again and again.
i was worried about the rig.  i've got over four years invested in this project.
okay, come on. time to slow down.
sure.  ten cents.
you work alone, savvy? you can't handle the job, i'll find someone who can.
you bet we made it.  martin, set course for irth and accelerate us into stardrive.
you're about an inch away from insubordination!
i did? what do i tell a source on the next tough story? hang in with us. you'll be fine... maybe?
what if we hand deliver to their homes or office?
maybe i can help.
subtlety really isn't one of you finer points, is it, osborne?
a tipoff in the right quarter to take his fingerprints and--
we desperately need a spice rack.  desperately.
no.  stick around.
you were afraid of him, weren't you?
how about the other one?  his friend.
please, boy, put it down and it's ok.
well, most guys don't. i mean that's the point. you all mind if i take my vitamins?
i want to say it because my whole life may depend on these next few moments.
he won't complain. he can pay off some of his creditors.
if i can.
what's that?
would you, doctor? that would be so kind.
she works at a church?
i took them out.
pretty much a disaster, tonight, wasn't it?
you heard.
what?
yes, i will write him and tell his ministers and the court.
he's your brother.
please doyle, don't.
you two have some sick sex thing?
but the funny thing is, take a look at these swiss bank account numbers. we got bobby, johnny, colleen... and julian grendel.
you got to keep very cool on this. icy god damn cool. cause baby, you just became the strongest weapon we got. let me guess, he wants you to call him, tell him what we're doing.
yeah, that's him.  buddy says glenn thinks you guys are real cool.
oh, yeah, i will...
i really do. for your own safety.
yes...  could you please give this to enzo.
i really didn't get a good look at her.
i'm sorry, was there a question in there?
i mean at least pick a more discreet place, the scalp, under the armpit, under the tongue, someplace where the trained eye won’t immediately look.
i'd like a little wine, if you have it.
you not with probation, one of those?
where do you send them?
yo, i don't have that kind of cash.
no... thank you!... i'll be bringin' the "caddy" by tomorrow.
no, rick. no, you see, victor laszlo is my husband... and was, even when i knew you in paris.
there's a big diner about ten miles on up... just outside fairvale.
because you're making decisions for me.
what about roger? he's free.
i want to know how tom grunemann got mixed up in it.
ah, beautiful.  i just can't see her leaving multiple grooms in the dust like that.
...yeah, sure.
when we first met, when you were 7, where was the house you lived in with your mother? do you remember your address?
ss'loka'.  it means literally "small but intelligent creature".  it loses much in the translation.
...like you?
yes.
thank you, mr. webster.
what else do you like?
that seems to be the leitmotif in your life; ever backing down.
the last i heard, a bunch of drunken militia have dug in on breed's hill.  with one stroke the british could cut them off and apparently their leaders are too dumb to see it.
no. i'm just a snoop.
how was it?
let me think about it.  hold it a day for me?
when you're frozen, you're legally dead, right?
define concern.
you're overestimating yourself again. what's worse, this time you're overestimating me.
forget it, pitts, you're coming.  meeks, your grades hurting too?
parry... i'm jack.
i think something's fucking connect- ed. i mean, a car tried to run me over the other day. doug too, right? we've got six guys here going fucking crazy.
let me have a look.
panes is not on your team anymore.
did she suck your dick?
we can keep it in the bathroom.
... damn!
that minimal
that's off now.
never do that again.
nothing.  we made it to the hospital.  i didn't have to go as far as i was prepared to.  but i was prepared to go all the way.
and, i'm pretty sure we got the beezer brothers out of tulsa coming in with us and i'm working on the silverberg boys in canada.
only problem is, you didn't put his lights out, you just got him mad. then he took it out on poor faz, god rest his soul. theo patches out.
here!  here... ten, thirty, fifty bucks.  how much have you got, chucky?  give mister laplante your money.
airport ho-jo!
maybe we'll be lucky this winter and have just rain, no snow.
laurie -- he's the most powerful man who's ever lived.  he's changed the world.
yeah.
bye-bye!
you're going to attack them?!!!
good! how is the patient?
miss johnson must be a real kindly lady.
angelo... i'm right this time.  we can still win this one.
time out.
i promise.
no, i didn't. i didn't kill anyone, sheriff.
i picked something up on the way.
enemies, bob? you been talking about the queen again? on independence day?
not until the last drugstore has sold its last pill!
right here. be here all afternoon.  you ready for this?
yes, yes, hit me...beat me, please.
yes, sir.
good to meet you, dr. wigand.
lay down, day-day.  stop moving.
i think you should leave it the way it was. it was good.
russian, french, italian, spanish, greek, german, a little hindu, some serbo croat and a smattering of swahili...standard pre-med background...
well, when you wonder, ask me.
i'm not interested.
i'm sorry.  i'm messing up the study.
a strange woman is a narrow pit!
he was a con man, wasn't he?
when?.....how?
yes, thank you.  it wasn't bad.
how long have you been into wine?
just say "i swear i won't kill anyone."
i think you should go home, but otherwise i think you should go. it would be great for you. you have to get away from here. the city's a sewer, you gotta get out of it.
it's open-house. no crashing involved. anybody in the hotel's welcome.
yes...
that's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams.
you guess he's your boyfriend? or you guess you're having a bad time with him?
i was going to tell him ... but in my own time. in my own time... .
yes, very strange.
price of doing business...
what's the problem?
what you do to me is unfair. the teasing, i mean.
i'm not being dropped anywhere without my money.

i'm kidding, i'm kidding, we're still young, darien. so what's money anyway when everybody's making it, it's all relative. after all, this is not the house in connecticut, this is just a crash pad good for a couple of years...before we slip our two lovely kids, yuppie and fruppie into the lycee francaise.
i know just the place. hang a left at the amalgamated tower.
we can't do our job unless he does his job.
you don't know that.
no, this happened to me once, almost, it was excruciating!
it's not your fault, theo.  you tried.
yeah? where?
missus fusari, missus canduso over there, she's inna big hurry, and...
i told her to come.
this -- ? this is nothing. you know what'll kill me?  her.
you do. seem to. have passion. in the classroom.
what's it mean?
this week anyhow.
and then steve looks at you with those hurt eyes -- like you don't care about children...
twenty minutes max.
sit down a moment, billy.  i'm afraid i have some bad news for you.
bingo.
a nap won't help. i've been awake for too long -- three or four nights. i can't even remember. if i go to sleep now, i'm dead for twenty hours.
it's started.
holly.
what's this?
my dear horowitz. in the first place, i'm paying you union scale. second, it's my piano. third, if everybody doesn't like kind of dying on the vine, they can get off the vine and go home. "liebestraum."
ahh...
you set up on lydia.  when she's on her way over to the apartment you give me the heads up.  i answer the door and pretend to be natalie.
i'm going to run.
the audition was called for 2:30. it is now nearly four.
where were you going?
bravo! bravo! our chairs are indeed almost touching! and we want to remain seated on them, correct? we don't want them snatched from under us, am i right? because if one goes, the other goes, and then - boom! boom! and we are both down before our time, you see? and neither of us wants that, do you agree?
what does it say?
of course.  naturally when mr. harris leaves, i won't see you in this hotel again.
is this because of your dad?
i mean i can't tell you.
no tricks, kirk. you have one minute.
gets on his plane in ten minutes, which means you two are done. you'll understand if i don't walk you out.
you're supposed to get hurt!
they come in any other styles or colors?
in the bathroom.  danny, can you get them for us?
however, we have come to believe that one joey pardella is involved in this ellingson virus. he or perhaps his accomplice has a disk that mr. belford needs to disable that virus. we want you to help us find it.
well, that's a long way off, sweetie. we'll talk to mom and dad...
actually, that's none of your business, christie, hut i can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap.
blue.
hey?
hey you two. lights out.
come along.  i know my way around a kitchen.  come along.
a sunflower?
i'd love a xanex.  sally, please don't tell sophia that i'm not breast feeding.

i don't think so. be happy to show you.
you ever lose somebody stephanie?
no, i ' m not.
this is gonna be cool! huh huh huh.
they are robots!
so who changes?
you kill me, you sign your death warrant.  and hers.
no, that's the point - he won't accept your favor!  the manager yes, but not the boy.
odds are -- she'll miss anyway.
what do they want?
so-so, johnny.
what do you mean?
you did?
no, of course not. i'll just clean up.
1959.
i don't want to move again... i like it here.
then, don't.
i don't know if i can picture uncle phil body surfing.
yeah?
why are you telling me this?
sure!  so i guess that means i'm an artist after all.
but i still want one.
no, please...
--shit--
a big one....
may i ask why?
no, dad, it isn't.
what the hell are you doing here, lothar?
i have hurt you and i am sorry for it.
and you play cricket?.
we can do that.
i loved you so much this day. on my bed in your panties. i remember i thought, how impossibly lucky am i to have you on my bed in your panties.
oh yeah.
oh no, i would have done that. but i would have made sure i killed them, too.
they're killing me by inches!  go ahead! make me suffer! milk me dry.
no.
go dance with your mother, jeffrey!
supposing one of those cables breaks under tow.
what about keith?
what if i could prove it to you, satch?
got any requests?
sure, in the war.  pull those cables--
equals?
kristen went on that convention today, didn't she?
penicillin. at least it will help keep his fever down.
oh nothing.
maybe we should start again, yes? i know so little about you, except that you're not what you say you are.
it's all good.  you got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank.  plus, i love these old black collectibles.
stokes is pullin' ah pants down.
yeah?
i swear.  i swear.  we've already got some requests to do a few dinner parties.
i didn't say anything.
you have a helluva way of answering.
you said, first, he was lying.  how do you know that, doctor?
billy, that girl couldn't have pulled you in there forcibly...
no dogs, huh? okay.
do you want to talk to  zoe?
what?
this... is my new home?
that doesn't mean it was rick's party.
i ain't no fuckin' kike!
happy. he said "happy?"
can't arrest ghosts.  but the best way to stop being haunted is to be with people.  you're here, you're not hiding, you've done the right thing, miss prescott.
well, then, i know it takes three -- four weeks for you to come round to admit when you're wrong... but by that time she's liable to be in china...
i'm sorry.  really.  what do you want me to do?
oh god... what have i done...
too bad.
what attitude?
since he sleeps with every girl you ever show an interest in, why don't you just keep your libbets thing a secret from him?
how about if you try disappearing.
what are you talking about?
yeah -- she did a good job.  this glass looks brand-new.
will you shut up... just give me a drink.
baker's man... but no use ruinin' a good pair of shoes over it.
i just made this picture, over at screen classics.  it opens next week.
it's genetics.  you know this.  you know where it comes from.  there is nothing wrong with uncrossing a few crossed wires.
even by you?
a lot sharper, sefton! i'd like to have some of that loot you got in those footlockers!
so, he's hiding in the dark...
the only good indian is a dead indian, does that old adage still hold true out here?
that's the door.
not at the moment.
i ain't goin' to jail, and i ain't doin' that probation thing again.
sir te!  it has brought him as much trouble as glory.  help him to leave these troubles behind. otherwise, he'll never be able to start anew.
what’s in the bag? underwear? to seduce your husband? or is it for your own recreation?  tell me, how come such a handsome couple sleep in seperate bedrooms? is it because he does it with little children?
how long will i stay here?
you have everything?
yeah.
she is upstairs.
there is a greater risk in staying here, you know.  if you don't find the princess, then the whole trip was for nothing... wasn't it?
"existential motifs in russian literature"! you're really close.
why?
darling, i talked to millicent.
'cause eddie woulda locked him up by now!
a short somewhere.
i drove to st. cloud to show mark and vanessa the ultrasound. and i wound up staying for a couple of hours.
i don't follow your logic. what does his being nice to you have to do with him wanting ordell's money?
i've called the hospital; they've notified consiglere genco's family to come and wait.  he won't last out the night.
you bought her some time, kola. ain't never gonna be over... but you bought her some time.
jesus.
i'm not interested in what your interior decorator would think, okay?!
yes.  cyberdyne systems, model 101.
i keep a lot of provisions right here.
lloyd, i want you to be big about this... the world is full of love tonight, no woman is safe...
lots more where he came from.
so you need my help?  oh my g-d, this is like asking me for help with your homework.  hey, mink, c'mere!
you filthy bastard. i should cave your fucking head in.
who?
you're serious!
your girl friend's name is ralph?
i call all you white guys "jack."
do you?
no sir.
you are reckless!
i guess about the same kind of things you do.
then why don't we go up and see the ruins?
the mother sure has her hands full.
look, norman, i'm not the shampoo girl.
no -- it has to be done by tomorrow.
i like you, maude.
uh huh.
some champagne, miss flaemm?
f-f-fuck you.
it's quite rare you know, some- thing so common in its time so well looked after all these years.
hungry.
what have you two been doin' to make it look so nice?
royalty do not help people with their luggage.
but before i retired, you might say i had a brief time in the sun. fame, as it were.  tell me, do you like motion pictures?
you don't understand you either.
i understand.
thank you.
i was raised in a baptist church got dipped in the water when i was 5-- born again before kindergarten...by the time i was 10 i knew it was bullshit and at 15 i ran away from home...
they're always writing to me saying they want to come to rome!
i will, and you remind me of the same thing.
naw, man. i gotta be someplace. i was kinda hopin you could come with me.
i didn't tell him shit. he worries too much. i love that old jew, but he's gonna kill himself worrying. we started this shit, and we're gonna finish it.
you ever notice how i always showed up, in the middle of a binge? left before it was over? how i sneak away for cap-naps? how when the crank came around to me, i always said i'd just done one?
terrific!  you <u>should</u> feel insignificant!
no.
what do you make of this?
recruit us to do what?
it's so... small.
sure thing. put them here... i'll take them.
give me the bat.
yeah... there's no straight lawyers in turkey... they're all bent bent as hairpins...
you will follow me.
sir?
sure -- certainly —- but what's that got to do with this?
chick was outright killed by a mob. he killed a white man that owed him some money and when they caught up with him, they tied him behind a car and dragged him from out of the hills back to town.
behold!
only i forget.  they give me pills, you know, to keep me... even... and... i forget things,
what kind of research?
c'mon, you know that won't...
<u>no</u>.  i keep getting hit with heads!
keep these. we're going too.
no. this is he.
shit ben! how the shit are ya?
why?
don't do that to me!
yes i would.  not kill you.  but blow off a few toes, absolutely. i'm entitled to that as retribution.  it'll help you to remember me in years to come -- every time you put on stockings. they must have prosthetic toes by now -- with little nails on them you can polish --
i've got lots of time.
i fear not, mrs. kendal. even in the short time he was gone the size of his head has increased rapidly... as is his pain.
machines don't fix themselves.
no! he's crazy - he's insane. he hates everybody. he's got these plans -  you've got to help me, james. i'm sorry. i'm sorry for everything. i know i was wrong - but you've got to protect me. i know you still love -
the presidency won't protect us, bob. we're beyond politics now ...
what's normal?
really?
thought i'd stay in. there's a good tittie movie on skinemax.
it's ours, indy. yours and mine.
escape hatch.  and dad was having a go about the garden.  something was misplanted...
now i feel like clarence thomas.
--it's called "morning sickness," asshole--
i sure don't hate you.
would that include me?
jennifer!
well, i'm starving.  will you at least buy me a hamburger?
do you still love her?
no i couldn't, i have to have church approval, and frankly, that's rarely given,-
if you don't believe me, let's watch this movie.  see if his name's on it.  how about it, harry? can i watch my damn movie?
'he'...?
i don't know what you mean.
please. i want you to. it would make me so happy.
she's a little sad, is all.
where do you think you're going?
i'm coming right over. i'll be right there.
why not? i must have subjects. it's the only way i can teach. it's the only way you can learn. the stupidity of the people the idiocy of their laws will not stop no -- nor will they force me to deal with such reptilian creatures as gray. we can do our own dirty work -- and we must.
your fuckin' head, huh? don't fuck around, tony.
well, son, i want you to know i hope everything works out with you and alabama. i like her. i think you make a cute couple.
but in your opinion, would i definitely go?
annie's a smart lady.
this is, uh, shawn, and, uh... bob and petronia.
why not? half the house!
i didn't know what was on it.
yea.
it's called a grilled cheese sandwich, you dub.
i like all of them --
it's in your play.
of course not. you have all the blankets. it must be ten degrees in here. i'm telling you, sarah, if you want to sleep with fresh air, you sleep on the fire escape. from now on that window is closed.
how long since you shot a gun at a man?  nine... ten years?
that's nice.  and you live in queens?  with a child, and a dog...?
i don't give a damn about the money. i want you, and i want to get us out of this shithole.  there's only one way to do that.
listen, she's running away from home for something like the fifth time in six months. it's terrible.
heavy, heavy duty. taku wakan. wanagi spirits. it's one of those few places we'd never go to as kids. still don't. some of the old people say crazy horse is buried back there. we have to go ray. together. like his vision.
great. on my fucking room.
...that's probably a more appropriate analogy.
his spiritual mother...
and then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could...
keeps fairies away!
let me explain about time- you've been here three months and already two months behind. and the germans and the french are gearing up. and i don't care about you and i don't care about the thirty dead- i care about my knighthood and if this railroad finishes on schedule, i'll get my knighthood and i want it.  professional hunters may be the answer.
let me just say something here... i have no idea if this is going to help.
i think so.
if it had been surgery on a living person, done to save that person's life, you would not question it.  not for a moment.  so, let me be the first to tell you, dear girl... on the other side of these sheltering mountains, a whole world has advanced beyond such plebeian thinking as yours.  and someday, no matter how much you fear it, that world will come to roust sleepy hollow out of its slumber.
i ache with it.
what is he doing there?
spend my days beheading country bumpkins?  i don't know, proximo, who has better wine than you? besides, i'm beginning to think of the colosseum as my home.
what are you doing?
no.
don't jerk me off. we all know what this is. you don't work with me if i work with you without knowing who i'm working for. now let's cut the shit. who's the man?
oh!--dear god, i did not think it would be me to tell you. a great loss to playwriting, and to dancing.
i said i'll take care of it. now, a man of your position shouldn't be a part of what's about to go down. so go home and i'll call you tomorrow.
i'm sorry, christ, i'm sorry!  how many more times do i have to say i'm sorry before you forgive me... ?
no reason to kill innocent bystanders.  shit.  i can't hardly move my neck.
dick-weed!
you'd have no objection to revealing yourself at this meeting?
keith, if anybody comes in here and asks for me, you let me know. right?
must be a spare set.
thank you.  i owe you a dollar forty--here--keep the change.
nice suit.  and today you are?
so they took care of leo.
i've seen it before.
tonight was supposed to be the night, trevor. remember? i couldn't believe you went through five dart games and didn't even joke about it.
shhh, my head hurts.
i'm glad you think so. if you ask me, it's foolish. i told you there's no sense in our staying here tonight. we could make new york in less than three hours.
is there any danger? some kind of virus?
is it alive?
aaron, how you doin'?
keep your shirt on. i got it -- right here.  one hundred -- two hundred -- three hundred -- four hundred -- and fifty. now sign.
what other job you got?
what are my choices?
i lied. i do have a boyfriend and he'll be here any second and your ass better be gone.
yeah, i remember you.
when do we get to see it? walter well...any time, i guess.
i don't fuckin' cook.
general mcaddie is who requested our coming here. we were awakened at three am and told to get down here immediately.
a.p.b.... he isn't breaking any law.  he's a grown man... he can crawl on his hands and knees to china if that's what he wants to do.
i dunno, boy.
not entirely.
i'm getting married tomorrow.
a boy or girl?
that's your monkey, denham.
bring your own wheels tomorrow night and you can stay as long as you want... well 'til eleven thirty maybe.
a rose by any other name would --
is he in the bathroom?
you can't be serious.
that's right.  gray, the cabman. i've had a bit of dealing with macfarlane in the past, you know.
i can't do that.  he's the man.  he'll fire my ass.
i know that! but *where* they gone?
go on, tell him. tell the truth. tell him how you feel, shooting a piece of hot metal in somebody's flesh who was once a child, who was once the same age as this boy. somebody's flesh who was innocent once.
that you found.  what do you mean you found it?
what do you mean -- haywire? you start out after murderers and come back with three-for-a-dime bootleggers. you start to solve murder mysteries and break up crap games. you're grand! i'm for you! stupendous!
i'd say we're in its home.
i didn't kill anyone, bernard, there was no one to kill!
that there is no such thing as evil with a capital "e."
we played down in jackson yesterday. heard a rumor you've got a boy up here who can hit the ball a ton.
i wouldn't mind being famous.
that word again! i don't even know what it means...
ordell pick up his bond?
come on speedy!
yeh, better i should forcefeed him burnt lamb and...couscous, was it she made him?  boy, kids go wild for that.
hi.
yeah?  what's the odds?
how long?
that is my least vulnerable spot.
so maybe watergate wasn't really about watergate--maybe that was just a piece--
you watch me, don't you?
it's incredibly rich.  we've been cataloging it in frames or 'pages'; right now we're on 10,413.
i'll call them, okay?
no, it doesn't...okay, look, i see what you're doing here, and that's, i'm sorry, but that's not it.  my marriage is fine. i've had some kind of "empty-nest" episode where i saw some things that weren't there.  let's deal with that.  i'm willing to deal with that.  i just don't want to go conjuring problems where none exist.
yes.  madame.
sorry.
both at the same bank...
i don't even know how much money that is.
all right, two thousand.
a month?  will doesn't have a month!  we've got to do something to help him!
england can make no move against you on the continent without austria.  a reliable treaty with austria would end her hopes in that regard.
not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is; shut up in prison, kept without my food, whipp'd and tormented. good day, good fellow.
oh, uh, listen, david called me up.
if it was a quarrel, how come you had the gun right there?
she ain't peckin' at your eyes, buddy.
mcmurphy, doc. r.p. mcmurphy.
that's lieutennt hurwitz. severe shell shock. he thinks he's ethel merman.
the contracts?  that's the easy part. finding the money to buy the company, that's hard.
i don't know... what you're...
what does she look like?
so why do you keep the picture up? you wish you hadn't quit?
too bleeding true, 'n' it.
oh -- so i'm just, what -- a poor substitute?
i didn't notice him.
you've got no jurisdiction.
fuck how they operate. just do it. like your man says, "by any means necessary."
you didn't say more than two words to me the whole way here.  you had another nightmare, didn't you?
i did not get the wrong man. i got the right man. the wrong man was delivered to me as the right man! i accepted him, on trust, as the right man. was i wrong? anyway, to add to the confusion, he died on us. which, had he been the right man, he wouldn't have done.
we're going to new york?
why?
look, it isn't proof, okay? someone may have put the chemical in the outlet, but we found it as a vapor in cosgrove's clothes.
i'm going to take it.
acknowledged ...  ...i'll talk to data.
what was that?
i want to know. we haven't talked this way in years.
hello.
just do what i say, alright?
you guys are new?
you a tourist?
she was just asking about you - whether it was nice to work for you or not.
is this enough to oppose 40,000 men?
what are you doing here?
looks like a two thousand pound to me. yeah, a two thousand pound bomb.
i wouldn't put it that way. but i love sharks.
only lab rats.  here.
we're half-brothers.  paul is mother's first child.  when his father died, she married my father. dr. rand, the missionary.  and you know what they say about missionaries' children.
no, i tell fortunes by reading the crease, now shut up and go to sleep.
i didn't even know who i was writing to -- just someone with the same last name. she never talked about any family.
hi.
sure, and i guess it was just convenient there was one less person to split the gold with.
not much point to this, is there?
shit.  i'm already sorry.
i'm just going in to do my shopping.
what?!
i'm afraid i can't do that, mr. daglish.
now. we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. i can stall if it's more, but i need time to find a good window .alright?
i'm sorry, i'm in a real hurry.  see you around, pal.
it's me.  claudia.  it's me.
hello, roper. glad you could join us.
washington sent ya. i know that.
yah -- gladys had me order that swan special made from mexico  in case becky won. i do a lotta business with those people. i always offer to pay 'em in tacos.  whoo, they love that.
you've been watching the film.
you can't do that.
why are you doing this?
benjamin -- where are you?
what?
he said you were smart.  he also said you were competing with your dead father.  how did he put it? trying to measure up to a ghost.
yes, sir. beluga. but it is eighty dollars the portion.
what's the matter, doris? business bad?
um-hum!
everyone is gone. rhonda is in the bathroom.
welcome to the new bureau. nobody shares information anymore, it's become synonymous with job security.
he only died two weeks ago -- i'm sure they'll still have him. hurry now.  i'll prepare the body.
so, what, uh, what train are you taking?
he knew what he was doing.  nobody forced him to rob banks.
sure, arnie. bring 'em on, i'm ready.
it does indeed, max.
... makes me...
look!  he's rusted again.  oh, give me the oil can -- quick!  oh-oh, quick!
yes... well good to see you on the mend. i've kept in constant touch with the hospital, of course, and now i've come to see you personally to see how you're getting along.
that's it, i'm goin'...
look, the ice is melting.
slow and low, adam a-500s...  ...carbon composite, stealthy, 1400 nautical-mile range, thousand ki payload...all the way to caravels and 727's from a source country to a transshipment point.  small freighters.  we've done containers...
what?
i was on a roll!  i’m a little overextended now.
-- listen to the man --
i forgot.
well, thank you very much. you can go now.
how you're saying she killed her parents?  did she kill bobby vasquez, too?
sounds like crap, admit it. and i'm not gonna have it. i'm rico all the time, okay, do you blame me? that's agreed, okay? we're gonna tell all these new people my name's rico?
sixteen. but my birthday's in seven months ...
yeah. and under other abnormal circumstances, i think this would be the time to seriously jump your bones.
yo pandora, quit hummm-ing... look at this.
some guys from ninth avenue jumped fanucci today; slit his throat from ear to ear.
where the spiral begins.
she told me she killed them.
i'm going to sleep in my bed. come on, lovey!
yeah, cured polio.
i've got it, elaine!  i've figured out what's wrong with the shuttle!
i still don't understand --
somebody's in a vengeful smiting mood today.
yeah.  you could say that.
telling when people have done something wrong?
wow... this one's cool.  and it looks just like a shotgun.
things can't get much worse can they?
your parents would be crushed to think you weren't happy with it.
ok.  claudia wilson: you tryin' to go deaf?
reliant could be hiding behind that rock.
everything's fine, pop.
the lost footage. at the convention. the mysterious device in our last episo--historical document.
forget ricky. you should be glad max got you driving for me.
doctor livingston.
junior kim was doa at the hospital.
pink ones.
i thought i might stop by.
they have repressed the creator.
oh please. not now.  she wants you to stop seeing what's- her-name. finally. now and forever. do you think that's too much to ask? for a wife of nineteen years.
that's my business.
tell me something; are all psychics, uh....?
five years. my son was born here.
hey!
only a week?
yes. it's very good, eve.
i can't believe he'd do this.
why don't you just stop figuring and keep working so we can get the hell out of here?
they're called subways. a nickel will take you from one end of manhattan to the other. helluva ride, too.
it's already planned, mike. it's going to cost $150 at the free clinic.
until i hear the truth.
help, i'm being held prisoner in a puzzle box factory.
what do you mean?
like treacle.
i can't take any more school.
he's out of the equation.  talk to me.
you keep too much to yourself -- you're a lone wolf.  it makes me uneasy, and if it makes me uneasy i can't imagine the impression you make on lesser employees.
second safety.
what are you doing?
half a day.
row! row! row!
i've died once already.  it wasn't so bad -- in fact i recommend it.
two and a half years as chief of starfleet operations may have made me a little stale, mr. scott -- but i wouldn't exactly consider myself 'untried.'
you're not a detective.
that he's got a pretty face.
yes basil?
i don't think so.
and let me tell you, long john. when you become a guy with a bank account, they got you.  yes sir, they got you!
so there's nobody around to get killed in the explosion.
how could i?  dave, as you know, president kennedy was assassinated on friday.  a man named lee harvey oswald was arrested as a suspect and then was murdered yesterday by a man named jack ruby.  we've heard reports that oswald spent the summer in new orleans and we've been advised you knew oswald pretty well.
that's the life spark.  exxence of magic and sorcery!
yes?
what do you know about my father?
who's "they"?
come now.  you've seen the graffiti -- all over the city in the few hors it has taken your men to drop like plague victims. what about your turf, top?  you don't seem to have ripped out anyone's heart yet.
i don't even want you to go. whaddya think of that? i got other plans for my life than dragging around some dumb cowboy that thinks he's god's gift to women. one twenty-buck trick and he's already the biggest stud in new york city. it's laughable.
the day i show respect to biff tannen will be the day i win a million dollars... what's the matter, biff, they're not showing you any respect down at the golf course? don't they realize what a tough job it is keeping the criminal element away from the country club?
never, what?!
they'll know when you go over to graff...
he's earned an early retirement.  but enough about losers; buzz fazeli is history. lets talk about your future.  i wanna show you something.
okay.  it's just, things are a bit hot for me right now.  if i get a signal...  i may have to leave suddenly.
oh my god.  i don't believe this is happening.
where... can i stay?
i'm not hungry.
eighty-two thousand dollars.
i think you liked it with him.
sure.
stay clean.
he probably has a history of this shit.
what did you study?
you're one hell of a detective, mrs. christian.
gale, your engine's still running.
what did she say the down payment was?
maybe you resent how busy i've been.
no, i'd slip out past the hotel district, behind greyhound...
that noise don't come from no ordinary bird.
i think so. i think that's one of the clues. it's a clue that tells us... to keep going.
no ... i can do this because i've spent my whole career building anti communist credentials.
you don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?
well, did he hear anything about your prospects for the new job?
causes sleep.
nothing. hold please.
is your father an artist?
what for?
no, i'm fine, thanks.
shut up and walk...
wood productions.  the mark of quality.
some fuckin guineas he sent me. it's midnight and the motherfucker's ordering an apertif.
why not, bobby?
what?
i'm not climbing that.
performing solo.  enjoying the concert so far?
well, i guess we're not, since we don't have dates .
my god, i wear the same scent as a transvestite. she is a transvestite, isn't: she?
fine! fuck it! when we're done she can i.d. me. i don't care. just tryin' to be professional, but no...
it's a simple story. earl williams works for the e.j. mcclosky manufacturing company as a bookkeeper for fourteen years. he starts in at twenty dollars a week and gradually works his way up to twenty-two fifty. a year ago the mcclosky company goes out of business and williams loses his job.  take it away, fred wilson!
no, sir.
he ain't so much good guy as he's just a bad motherfucker. sonny don't be bullshittin'. he fucks dudes up for life. hold on, a fight scene's coming up.
yeah. my brother told me.
toons aren't given imperfections.
don't be sorry. i've never been happier. i feel like i've been handed a new life.
i don't know him.  mr...
yes, miss ratched, this is correct.
look, it's not always luck, i mean, depending upon the placement of the numbers, a guy with 10 cards could win just as easily as a guy with 100.
vada, just put 'em on the stool.
yeah -
how many pills were in that bottle?
oh, yeah, really?  really?  how-how'd you like it? was it-was it, i mean, did it... was it heavy? did it achieve total heavy-ocity? or was it, uh...
well, we'll let that one go.  now -- how many battalions you got?
had the boys follow us.
this is horrible!
bud fox, i look at a hundred ideas a day. i choose one.
no. but you tend to tie them up.
no, he's not dead!  he lives in baldwin hills.  i met him recently, and he wants to be in our picture.
this is your dream, reed.  you should be the one up there.
no.  i'm just not sure what you mean.
just until we find another girl.
and i bet you say that to all the girls --
i padded your expense account for the last six months.
mrs. delaney.  did you hear the latest?
...then you rip my clothes off. then we rip lyndsey's clothes off. i think i've got it.
i don't drink intoxicants.
okay.
okay. promise?
try standin' in the door and hollerin: mama i'm home.
good.  i will make the preparations.
so?  someone'll send it on ahead.
you're certain?
that's gone long ago.  i've got to see him.  where is he?
sue ann, i thought you of all people would back me up on this, you know what del's like. how did he take my note?
really?  i want to make sure that i understand what you're telling me, greley.  a crime was committed in new york city?  that is news.
i don't think i'll persuade you. you'll do it or you won't. dr. bloom is working an it anyway, and he's the best...
yes, that's exactly what i mean. and agent rodgers?... this conversation never occurred.
leo?
easy, dad!
yes.
nothing?
jesus, lenny.
whaddya mean?
a shark fin?
gently!!
i thought it might begin the healing process.
he's a great writer –
give me your word of honor that that's all you're going to do.
you son of a bitch.  did you really think you could elude us forever, carlos?
very much.
huh?
i'm authorized to get you out of here.  i thought that's what you wanted.
hold on, son...who's this colonel greenhill you're talking about?
holidays are our busiest days.  no one likes to be alone on holidays. i know i don't.
that's exactly what i am.
next week.
if you don't - can you still afford to go to harvard?
yup. huh huh.
how much is that?
they were the ones that put us together.
you're too quick for me.
yeah, but we're talking 43.
you dream about dead guys?
gunnison -- how did you get to be such a big editor -- with such a small memory?
probably an asteroid field ....
she's right.
it changes.  there are eleven levels. each one is a different layer of the arcade universe.  the concept is, you're entering the video game itself, making your way across the circuit board to the logic core ... arcade's brain.
only the best for my mother.
of course.
i know you're not talking to me...
nothing has. but that's all changing.
smart as well as quick. now what do you have to give us?
why—uh—
let's get something straight, jeff -- i never asked you to leave your wife.
president's speech.
oh yeah, sunday night. you guys been out tasting today?
maybe it was just its time to finally fall apart.
why not. i trust you. you couldn't turn me in because of doctor-patient privilege... and i don't want to be "withholding"... and i know where you live.
roger, i'm starting to get pissed. just drop this fuckin' donut shit, and gather your gear.
the deepest secrets, the forbidden formulas...
no, you listen. we're partners now and even though i'm running the show for you, i'm still running the show. that means i get a little respect. so i don't want to hear anymore of this scooter, buddy, junior, skippy, tiger, bullshit. it's jake.  and i gotta tell you, for a guy who spends all his time in a gym, you could be in better shape.
peter parker, you have no idea what i did this weekend.  or didn't do. it's no business of yours either way.
at least you're honest.  call me by my middle name--eugene--if you're going to be jerome, you may as well start getting used to it.
nothing to tell.
well, you can't believe everything you read in magazines.
you were saying that under the right circumstances, a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit.
why don't you want to go to your high school reunion?
mcmanus has a friend in the fourteenth precinct. they're coming out for one job - thursday. they're picking up a guy smuggling emeralds out of south america. fenster and mcmanus have a fence set to take the stuff.
what?
yeah.
defuse the bomb, please.
so some people need different kinds of "convincing" than others....  hey, just sign the petition!
yeah,  come off it, eric. who is it?
talk about it. right now, i mean. i got to ... um ...
you've got to stop using that word "we" it's getting kind of scary. right katka?
you've got a warped thought process. your brain doesn't function properly.
yes, but this is not a ballet. this is a dance at figaro's wedding.
down the street and across. greely's beer garden and billiard parlor. just ask for alice and say you want a game of billiards.
you knew i liked the rentals at liverpool street.
nothing further, your honor.
be nice. her father died in that twa flight the government shot down...you know i'm going to be in the city next week. my mom says it's okay that i stay overnight at your dorm...it'll be nice to see you in                          ] a different shirt.                                          ] ] wichita                                            ] oh, i didn't tell you. i wear this                          ] all year round. the chicks dig it...                        ]
just shut up.
nothing is more important.
bobby and ricky.
get going! 
alex.
i think someone's watching.
oh let's not...
i also gotta win.
an invitation. to a 'formal picnic'...?
sit down.
i know, i know.
real 'quality-timers,' hugh.
yes,  she's a little odd, i understand.
i want to go home.
then in a six month time we're on our own; is that it?
how old is anna?
we had a deal.
kurtzweil, we think.
joking? no, ma'am. oh no! i mean business!
and people better clear out of here! now!
they guys treatin' you all right?
yeah, he's married--but then again, he,s not dead.
who are they?
i don't know what happened to you, jack ... but i can't believe you were always this much of a bastard.
i did, sir.
maybe we should try a different kind of dancing.
not for me.  i don't go in the water, remember?
i think he was working on them today, so they're probably in his office.  could you find them and see who they belong to?
alex, it's just the zoo.
you're really...  you, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
no.  we go straight.
you think it over, leon.
did i say dinner?  i meant diner. biscuits and gravy, you love that shit.
that was a long time ago.
it will be perfectly all right, walter. mother is coming with us on the train.
franz!  help!  lunatic!
...so accomplished.
so?
they were ready to blame him for anything, no matter where it happened.
theories?
you had one guy "like that?"
yeah.
i hate him too.  so i just call him "mavis." or "sissyboy." or "mavis the sissyboy."
what about ripley?
if i see him.
my mommy and daddy did that?
what?
that is none of our business.  but you bring me something for the next edition if it's only a recipe for spaghetti! 
i'm just borrowing them.  you'll get them back tomorrow.
yeah, and a dimple.
yes.
look at her.  now, wake me in an hour, i'll take over.
no. a poor little rich boy who thought he’d save a few kids from their retailer. he disappeared on his second shopping expedition.
no way to take another day or two?
well, you've been through it.  you know. you could make things easier for me.
yes... why?
oh, sorry i spoke.
this guy laplante won an award?
no, not a thing.
yeah. the graduation dance mr. hand. it's the last school event of the year.
that's good. that works.  uh, you know, i want to ask you something... i know it sounds odd... but...
you're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school...
but he's never said a word-
sure you could, earl -- but you wouldn't want to do that, would you? you wouldn't want to kill anybody.
she's very beautiful.
just go! go! dammit punch go!
but...  i didn't wish... i didn't want him dead!
so...wanta make love?
they said the same thing about myopia and obesity.  you think your children would be less human if they were less violent, angry, spiteful?  maybe they'd be <i>more</i> human.  from where i sit the world could stand a little improving.
all right.  what is it?
now you get dressed and we go out.  i got a babysitter and everything.  trust me, you need it.
saunders--
tell me where is jack foley, i don't bother you no more.
don't flatter yourself. i take pictures of a lot of junk.
hi, mary.
anything. aw hell...just tell her the truth.
i don't...  i don't... geez, i don't know, i've... i wa- this... yeah, i got this vw out there...  what a jerk, yeah. would you like a lift?
mister worf... find data if you can, but your top priority is isolating the borg.
where is he?
that is what i said, doctor.
i do.
there's gotta be something - -
oh, i forgot to tell you, they're prescription x-ray glasses. i have very bad astigmatism.
good night.
all right then...  ...five million dollars!
okay.
i don't understand 'friend.'
you know what he is talking about here?
i don't understand.
well, i'll be - !  he does have a bicycle.
have you been to any parties?
not a very good one i'm afraid.
the second r is silent.
out!
you can't kill me. you gave your word, charlie.
we won.
but what becomes of our souls?
vat about it?
never!  i'm going in and ask him—
reticular fibers. we ought to be clear of them soon.
your secretaries were all kind enough to give me a look around the office...
i know....i know.
i might have to look into that...
so what did i have an effect on ?
not tonight.  bad timing.  sorry -
look, i'd really like to...
we worked it all out beforehand.
give me back that hot dog. i'll eat it myself.
he tortures toys -- just for fun.
oh well that shouldn't take you more than another, oh, two and a half or three years, should it?
fair enough.  the river.
i felt a lot safer having it. my milk went bad when i was in jail.
eh.  week from tomorrow.
come on, i'll take a break and we'll all dance.
he didn't leave with them.
and you have to meet my father.
just now.
i don't think it has, but i'd like to check that. simpson, what's the log on that?
often.
mom!
is that so important, mrs. brenner? you liking me?
well, then, how 'bout maybe we call someone?
yes.
bullshit it's not accesory. i didn't do shit. you call the cops, you explain it was an accident...
where?... the new york times. the first one was -- "he handles produce well." which we already knew!  the point is, you have a lot of the signs.
what's that got to do with it?
sure --
10 years ago? halloween? he's jamie's uncle.
he probably figured she was on her way out anyhow, no drugs in her system, no foul play.
editorials?
no. not really. inez speaks a little.
i can't tell you, amy.  you know i can't.  you have to trust me...
see to heinrich...  now...you can break the code key...?
but i'm concerned with everything, mr. bebe.
i was in here -- and they had some kind of murderer in with them. they were hiding him!
i will not do it.  you'll have to get somebody else, because i will not.
someone else's--where the fuck are they gonna--
just 'cause i'm not rich don't mean i don't love her.
who'd want to?
paul, let me enlighten you about something. you and i exist on two opposite sides of a great existential divide, that being your pathetic virginity on the one hand and my astonishing number of sexual conquests on the other. i'm off to get laid. see you.
edward.  my name is edward.
i don't know anybody who'd be interested in that.
just what i said. that's what i --
they asked about you.
i'm sorry...i'm sorry...i'm sorry...
your next life, maybe.  who knows. that's how these things go.
cheerios and wieners.  i made it myself.  it's good.
the town of spectre. best kept secret in alabama. says here you're from ashton, right? last person we had from ashton was norther winslow.
there is no such regulation.
i did it for you.
don't you even think about it.
where are we now?
sorry, sir. i didn't mean that.
marion, everyone knows you're not like that--
it's not yogurt -- it's mayonnaise.
i will.  and good luck with your show.  i hope it's a huge success. you've worked very hard.  you deserve it.
the neuro-filter acts like a surge protector, regulating the infinite flow of information from cerebro to the professor's mind.  it's what keeps him from being crushed by the consciousness of millions.
he'd give me a job.
come on, let's check the bite radius.
are we?
are you all right, barney?
i leave the answer to god.
i expect that's for you to know and me to find out ...
how about new york?
you <i>are</i> cold. where have you been?
sit completely still with both hands on the wheel -- until they get here.
i'll keep that in mind, sir.
oh yeah? and who's gonna come to save you, junior??
...not a single frayed collar or cuff, new haircuts, fresh shaves, clean hands - new shoe leather. look at the ear of the cop... that's a wire.  what's a cop wearing a headset for?  i think they're actors, chief; they're not cops.
what?
he's my teacher!
yes.  don't hurt me.
only cowards make crank calls, sweetheart, nothing is going to happen.
you've got to tell me what she said.
hey, don't worry. chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
you might say i'm at the top of their shit list.
what are you doing here?
what are you saying?  that you don't have sex with men?
hey, i’m doing the best i can...  i’d like to see you hit a squash ball after seventeen beers...
where the hell are you taking us anyway? just blow something up already.
yes ... yes. the problem also involves the un. i don't know what it's worth, but this way, we'll give the un the possibility of evaluating our strength.
he was very good. better than some people would think.
yeah, but at what a price.
the big one.
the opinion of a scorned lover is hardly an objective view.
i'm aware of that, but i don't think he's in any condition to make requests. i'm trying to appeal to your more...logical self, father.  i'm concerned about harm to my patient.
work's good for the soul.
i believe so.
give me the god damn mirror!
...he does now...
your mom and dad will have to call kindly doctor so-and-so to dig up your dental records, because there won't be much left of your face.
no-one will believe this melt-down was an accident.
this brand.
well, i, uh, i'll be leaving town for a little while.
who are you revolting against?
i wasn't cheating!
feel? i dunno... happy.
oh really? nothing? my dad doesn't do anything unless there's something in it for him.
edgar, think twice.  he works in the kitchen.
oh, i was just checking the, ah...  ...you know, lookin' in.
funny.
i'm not that crazy.
i haven't had a chance to think. first i was just trying to get the fuck outta there. and after we got away, i've just been dealin' with him.
yup.
yeah.
and some pecan pie.
and before that?
then they can watch.
all is fair in "heaven," ted-baby.
are you pulling my leg?
aw, forget it.
you won't be able to miss them.  can't miss them.
pete, what happened to you?
what'd he say before? he saw a girl?
now i know...
well, anyway, it's *something* like that--  and it *is* important. that--that steering committee has *got* to see it that way. and i'm sure senator paine will do all he can--  he's a fine man, miss saunders, isn't he? he knew my father, you know.
your homie, glenn.  only thing, he went to the men's about a while ago and never came back.
all of them?
thanks.  what's in there?
no, no, we're fine...
you mustn't take it so hard. bucharest wasn't built in a day.
it is my job.  i did it when he was happy and it was easy.  it is only fair i do it now when he is ill.  enough talk.  i must wake up the master.
you romeo's sure pay a high price sometimes - anyone i know?
well, i've seen her pictures, and i don't think she's so hot.
what... what are you saying?
why?
she's dying. but i could still hear her big mouth.
m'mm.
what?
good.
thanks for everything, taylor. will i see you again?
no.  why?
let's find out.
nor i, on the second.
that's entirely understandable.
i understand the <i>business</i> reasons.
yes.
i'm afraid not.  i can't make it tonight.
there was one bad moment -- some hunters stopped us.
i suppose. but they got here first, the lousy bastards. so now it's all over, i guess.
have you decided about pilgrim?
he runs call girls.  primo tail. fixed up like movie stars.
boy, that is the real south. that is real corn liquor.
shit.
why is it just lying there? why doesn't it get up?
you no-good pup!
as i said, it is beyond our comprehension.
who's fighting? i mean, i'm, you know, tell me what it's for.
the sacrifices i've made because of that man.  he's ruined me with his ego, his philandering, his--  his-his-his-his mediocrity!
you'd lie about anything.
we ought to start camping again, dad.
it's very becoming to you, mr. selectman.
well before there was black or african american, there were negroes.  i'm a negro.
what am i gonna do?! i mean, like, for the rest of my <u>life</u>?!
my treat. you were saying... something about how stupid you've been?
some bath oil?
i'll be right over.
take that back or we ain't friends no more, claude banks.
excuse me?
okee-dokee, doggie-daddy.
guess you don't want to see the greatest show on earth. and in detroit no less. well, take care, chief.
oh, come on, roy.
are you crazy?
he wants me to break a leg?
i wouldn't know where to start.  i guess it was about one man framing another. he thought if the other guy got blamed, people would over look his own wrong doings.
just, realize... this is not some common lunatic.  the type of intestinal fortitude it must take... to keep a man bound for a full year.  to connect tubes to his genitals.  to sever his hand and use it to plant fingerprints.  he's methodical and exacting, and worst of all, he's patient.
never one.
this is bandit i, come back.
will this proposition entail my dressing up as tina turner?
no.
kings are killed, mr. garrison. politics is power, nothing more. but don't believe me.  don't trust me.  do your own work, your own thinking.
all right. the wallaces leave at seven.
oh yeah.
you tried to run away in my taxi but your friend -- sport -- wouldn't let you.
i'm doin' business here!
you ever try to run in high heels?  you probably did.
yeah!
yes... you run this hotel.
hasta siempre.
he'll have you -- and tom.
not here.  i'll call you and we'll rendezvous again.  we have to leave separately, so we aren't seen together.  for your safety.
how do you do?
nobody.  at least not yet.
but there're so many wonderful things to write about, bob.
not a holocaust --
then why'd you ask?
no, no. i just took it.
i had to excuse myself from a meeting. it's ridiculous. i kept thinking about the baby... you... and, i swear, i was going to start bawling right into my briefs.
he has a big mouth.  yes!  it seems to me i did read something about that incident as a student.  but you have to remember that a worm -- with very few exceptions -- is not a human being.
yes.
good. when you love them they drive you crazy cause they know they can. but you like him?
not without a shot of the nest.
yes, that is correct. i think you should ask mr. rand that.
yeah, well, thanks for sticking your head in.
i want to do it right.
let 'em complain. i'm the one who's here.
i looked all over for you last night, you know that?
he's saying it's like forty years worth of new memories have been jammed in my brain since last year. overload city. 'sat about the gist of it, doc?
maybe that bartender made it up. i mean i think coyotes are rather beautiful. maybe "coyote ugly" is really a compliment. like someone who's conventionally "ugly" but is really beautiful.
it was *i* who rose in this chamber to accuse him. he is saying that i was carrying out criminal orders on falsified evidence--
say, let's get something straight here. i don't want any part of this thing. if you've got an idea i'm going around lecturing to people, why you're crazy! baseball's my racket, and i'm sticking to it. come on, colonel, let's get out of here.
mr. chang, if you don't mind, i think i'll go on being amazed - in moderation, of course.
twelve seventy-five from the clarence? the son-of-a-gun made a detour!...  but he got you here.
listen to me, mrs otto.  listen very carefully.  i do know what's best.
what? are you ashamed that we did it?
yodeling?
if he doesn't shut up...
i can bring her back. the same way drew and me brought zowie back...
hey, when this plan completely goes to shit, what are ya gonna do?
the pearls won't break -- they hold together and bring me bad luck ---- i hate them!
no, thank you.
so, what do you say, let?
most of the current chiefs -- they must have pretty hefty prices on their heads.
because, baby, you're looking to find love in an institution, that's your only chance....
and we are gaining... stand by, tractor beam!
it was all junk!
shatner.  william shatner.
definitely.
you always have been.  we're all descendants of the same stars, ellie.  all made of the same primordial atoms.
there are some real bastards in this department who don't mind breaking a few eggs to make an omelette, but thank god there are the new boys like me who want to maintain decent civilized standards of terrorist eradication. we've got the upper hand for the moment, but they're waiting for us to slip up, and a little slip- up like this is just the chance they're looking for.
we bought him in kentucky. my mother and i took a trip down there to see him.
you don't really --
[no!]
you'd meet doctors, lawyers -- nothing wrong with them necessarily if they're divorced.  why settle for some cowboy cop who drinks too much and cheats on his wife?  that's the way those hotshots are, all of 'em.
because it's the rules!
busy day, my little fire chief. why don't you climb into bed, and i'll meet you there in just...
thanks.
you want me to leave?
of course.
oh shit it's my cell!
you're a witness, doc!
for what?
okay, okay.  i'll call the girl.
it isn't her fault if she's popular... what?
i'm not heartless, ma'am.  i have every sympathy for you and for the little girl, but if i were to consent to every operation brought to me, i'd have no time for teaching -- and that's a great responsibility upon me, ma'am -- a great responsibility.
he's in the bathroom...  he's fine.
her name was maggie muldovan.
me? no. don't want none either. such bastards, man.
i will wave to you.
but, why?
it's hard to believe anything at all happened yesterday, isn't it? it's so beautiful and still now.  i think i've got it all figured out, by the way.
unlock one of the other storage rooms.  we're going upstairs.  we'll leave a trail back to 1012 and try to trap the monster in here.
no, i meant you didn't have to tackle me and rip my dress.  a polite push, perhaps?  a clear shout of "watch out, anna" would have done nicely...
weird?  you mean like you hanging out with that homeless, poke?  i saw you last night after the game.
where's burke?
how's granma since we got her in the tent?
what the hell are you doin' with da's gun!?
they came all the way from tarzana.
you want to do this yourself?  i don't have to do this, you know.
so where'd you get in?
thank god this plate was already fixed.
then what is the...?
go ahead.
oh god, i don't think so.
why don't you try sitting up?
every ship but your four fastest, you mean.
then it's time to change that --
hong kong?  i'm not in hong kong.  i'm in hollywood -- right at sunset and vine, two minutes from the station.  how about i pick you up right now and take you to dinner?
i'm 'bout four miles ahead of you, turkey.
because i should have shown her before... everyday, i should have shown her.
i lost them, that's what happened.
i knew that voice sounded familiar.  what's up?  how's it going?
hey, fuck you, man.
if you don't like it down there, why don't you quit?
look, could you just open the door so i could talk without shouting?
if you lose, then that hot little porsche of yours is mine.
after all you did on our farm?  you miss it, don't you jesse?
commodus is just a young man, he'll learn what you had to learn.
you know the regulations well, major.
i'll have to do better than that.
i insist.  there clearly isn't room for us all, i'm the least able to dig, and i'm not one of the walking wounded. those are facts.  besides, if i remain it's the most effective method of persuading my husband to abandon whatever he's doing and rescue us. it's hard to argue with this logic.
jean? hello? jean?
no! i can't think of anything more sappy!)
i'm saying: ... and what's wrong with that.
i wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment. i mean, is this really gonna have to one of those big brother -- little brother "you broke my gi joe and i'm still pissed" games?
just checking, young sir.
no.
they say sex is great for cramps.
right...because every ant's important!
believe me, i don't blame you.  this is the governor, lynn. say hello.
oh, it's you!  you got a lot of nerve -
yep.
no. i didn't know that.
icarus, please, if you want me to give you a bath just say so.
okay...
oh, god, that's too much responsibility for me.  it's not fair!  i want a less complicated life, frederick.  i want a husband, maybe even a child before it's too late.
no... can i come in?
is there anything that isn't?
oh --
i saw you play, man.  you were good. like a fucking freight train i remember saying.  so what happened, injuries or what?
paul.
got any kiss?
praetor, we've come to romulus on a matter we were -- assured was of great importance. if you have anything to say to us as representatives of the federation, i suggest you do so now.
as long as the roots are not severed, all is well and all will be well in the garden.
he is traveling with a lady.
will you be quiet?!
okay...don't forget to get another therapist for next week.
i am, as a matter of fact.
bob... it's tearing me apart.
okay.  okay.  de-nail ain't just a river in egypt.  she's probably stealing the money to pay for an abortion.
virginia...?
and you ask questions, right?
i have to, valerie.
well... i've got another project i wasn't gonna tell you about. lugosi's in it, but he's got a smaller part.  the lead is an ingenue, a sterling young actress named dolores fuller.  the title is "bride of the atom."
shouldn't we care about everybody?
if you really believe in god, why is it so inconceivable that his enemy is just as real?
no, thanks.
in the other man's rectum.
i took care of everybody.
go!!!
you won't run.
look, would you --
yes, i'm sure they do.  this place is everything you said it was, amilyn.
fuck it, is what i say.
scattered reports, sir.  rumors. nothing reliable.
this is embarrassing, really.   i shan't tell this story when i return home.
she doesn't give a shit about him.
some.  but i mean we aren't all so... handsome.
for christ's sake, violet!  i heard you!  thin walls, remember?
he's my collar!
well, are you?
daddy!
where’s your wallet? have you got a wallet?
mm.
what can i tell you?
natasha! natasha feastavich!- but we called her nashie fooshie!
dick, let go. revenge will eat you alive. trust me. i know.
what will you do, colonel?
what is wrong with you?
give me the big'uns.
how do you mean, exactly?
it will?
...my fee? wade, what the heck're you talkin' about?
i'm only on tv because i gotta be able to hang around the casino. you understand that. you know that. come on.
beverly hills hotel. i've got enough cash in my pocket for one night.
that's what they called it. a fast trip right down the ladder.  right to the primal fear, the base anger. i'm tellin' you, it was powerful stuff. but i don't need to tell you. you know.
it looks that way, doesn't it?
that's fine.  it's nice to meet you.
to risk one's life against such people is an imposition.
go on then! pa's in the barn saddlin' the fort worth stud... an' you can take the light gelding with the blaze...
saks.  if he knew you did that! they're all asking me, 'what is she doing,' as it is.
he's alright, but my dad can take him.
unbelievable.  this is a nightmare.
with ordell?
oui, doctor, oui.
he drives a carriage.
if i hadn't done it.  if i'd said to myself, "screw it.  i'm going to let all those people down there live."
hunh-uh.  not yet.  look, don't take any of 'em on your bike, okay?  call a cab if you wanna go somewhere.
you always overreact, clark. how terrible can it be?
that's what i'm telling you, baby. the babies love that stuff. they don't want all that sensitive shit. you start talking to them about puppy dogs and ice cream. they know what you want. what do you think? you think they don't?
that sets it off.
aren't you afraid of me?
i just can't. okay?
a sheep dog or something. turn slowly and let's walk away.
i'm all for it! it requires patience and temperance and a lot of sweating- out... otherwise, though, it's only hard work.  but if i can see you, touch you even as simply as this... i won't mind.
hope you’re ready, sid. we got one last surprise for you.
i'm blind because my father drank.
shhhhhhhh!
it was self-defense, tubbs! they're dirty!  i walked in on something, i don't know what -
who gets killed?
f for...
yeah, i thought about that as i was driving... and... i haven't found somebody in my world.  you found anyone in yours?
relax. the most important question is where to eat. i hope freddie made a reservation.
what's that mean?
i know, i know.
they think it's the word of god, and it's holy, and the flesh isn't....
i know that, claire.  i, we <u>all</u> know...
i have to talk to her, col --
that's weird.
i'll be twenty next year, sir.
good.
with what just happened upstairs --
the smartest thing i ever did was to make that trip.
don't worry about it -
i think you do.
i think so.
"of the silvery moon,
the report didn't mention nails and eyes.
well it's fixed, so you'll have to eat it.
i have been patient and i've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that.
i'd call them excuses. and the first excuse on both our lists was our "sense of duty." we convinced ourselves that it was more important than anything else. and you know what? it's not.
martini out!
i am sleepy.
it just won't do, will it? i go two and a half years without being able to write a word, and then, when i finally get started on something, when it looks as though i might actually be coming to life again, you show up and start breaking everything in my house. it just won't do, will it?
it's in the area of narcotics, mr. reynard, that the government tramples on the fourth amendment.
"greetings.  i am the count."
what of?
they may have already, so we protect the living.  proof she's alive?
bobby... ssshhhh... you killed mike.
sir, it's very possible this asteroid is not stable.
i stole four beers from my dad.
you think they could talk to each other?
she was born after they put me away. how can i have feelings?
god, i'm so sure. don't blame me, blame heather. she told me to haul your ass into the caf pronto. back me up, heather.
oh no.
you do?
i've been on the job.
is that true?
wants me to keep him posted on all your movements up here.
you said that thing was big as your hand.  i don't think i'm going to miss...
what are my other options?  in fifty years?  never?
come on, pal, come on willie, come on, old shoe...
well, it hasn't happened yet - has it?
tryin' to get this fuckin' tv to work. paid all this money for it and still can't get a station a mile away. and mr. wizard here ain't no help.
they taught me at the fbi.  i was very good at it.  it scared me... i liked it.
difficult.  i'm difficult.
it was done.  when sophia put the kids to bed, america brought otis in the room and closed the door.  it was done.
my only visits to rome, senator, have been through books.  but the war's over, time to close the door of war once and for all.
you did last night.
you could always say you have to go the bathroom.
i wouldn't mention the following, except he was very insistent.  it's obviously some sort of prank...
that's not what i meant, dignan.
my god, my god!  he talked to the new york times?
they gave you only four days?
don't have to... some mating semaphore is pretty hard to miss.
no thanks.
that is true.
i don't need pills... just sleep.
yes sir, boy, they, heh, they say that old fats just shoots the eyes right off them balls.
like you protected landry?
probably the next meal.
from god.
before black vomit starts its set, don will have his head blown off. the papers next week will reveal that he was partners with bobby, johnny, and collie in 'the grendel records scam.'  he killed them to pay off a debt to 'the mob' or something lame like that.  and then the mob iced him.  it's all more tasteful than it sounds.
goodbye.
i don't want to.
...friday?
hate this part.  just sweating it out on the sidelines.
do your job, get me a bourbon on the rocks and a pack of lucky's.
alexander knox. gotham globe.
there's an item you picked up that's marked.  will you read it?
goddamn geek!
lighten up adam. show some character.
okay. i'm delighted to have someone to talk to, and you're very cute, so i'm very flattered, but i'm also very married so you may as well forget -- you are trying to hit on me, aren't you?
what, by a st-stranger?
catherine tramell.  it's part of her game.
only it was more like, you know, sleep- walking.  all i know is i woke up on the cellar floor next to it.
i didn't, baby, you just told me.
okay, but if i get yelled at, i'm never gonna listen to this show again.
this is not my problem.
yes -- i feel i must apologize to everyone for my behavior for the last six months.  i have, as you know, been slightly down in the mouth.
i know. you have a way of making an impression.
ted, divorce is a terrible thing. i know, i went through it. you've got to believe i did everything i could to get joanna to stay.  but i'll tell you something. you may not want to hear it, but it took a lot of courage for joanna to do what she just did.
including you?
that's okay...
i'll tell you what... i think it's all you've got.
we put out a lot of material through our contacts in the newspapers...about mccluskey's being tied up with sollozzo in the drug rackets...things are starting to loosen up.
i can appreciate what your majesty is saying but the emperor has staked everything on this policy.  he has no other way to attack england, and no one knows more than your majesty how his overtures for peace have been rejected.
i'm pulling up right now. evacuate the fucking van! plans have changed! <b> ext. texaco station -- next
where have you been...
why can't we just talk to the authorities?
where can we go?  i can't go back into that zoo.
someone put it on me.
no.  not yet.  not for about forty years.
tranquilizer.  causes drowsiness.
who's this?
she was killed in the park two months ago--in the daytime.
you telling me what to do, roderick?
and 290 "disregards," right?
sssshhh. on screen the phone rings. the young girl pulls the shower curtain aside to reveal a robe hung on a hook. she grabs it, running from the bathroom, into the living room, grabbing the phone.
doesn't it seem odd to you that five different waterfront locals were broken into last night and the only articles removed were financial records?
you're a sex junkie, you know that, carl?
yeah?  well, fuck you.  sorry doesn't feed my kids.
i own a comic book museum. it's called the limited edition.
you won't regret this, mr. shreck.
they mocked me. they were representations of people i dearly loved yet they knew these people were gradually fading from me, and that in time all i would have left would be vague feelings - but sharp photographs! so i tossed them out. my memory fades, i know. but i prefer pictures made by me with feeling, and not by kodak with silver nitrate.
benjamin -- do they know you?
will, they never get to see kevin and a few more days...
because i was driving behind the bus, mary.  because i saw it.  i saw it happen...
hey.  what should i do if i see benny?
what are you talking about?
the milkmaid's daughter?
your mother is a rather miserable woman . . . isn't she?
i'll never give up.
it does, huh?  clark kent, i'd like you to meet lois lane.
whoooaaah!  shhiiittt!  whoooaaah!
well here i am.
how do you intend to disappear? you're probably the most famous couple in america.
i dunno...
of course.  of course!  where?  can't i bring it to you?  for god's sake, baby, please, just tell me what's happened, what could possibly be so bad?
you killed him.
is this the only way?
well, remember how you told me about "lightning striking"?  the nature of it's in there somewhere.
it has nothing to do with you.
eight, six, and four.
you're kidding.
well, my theory is that people can really enjoy math, but they lose interest...
puffed cheese?
yeah, i was bailing.  i have a friend, and he's really... well, he's really vampire, i guess.  bad scene.
i have excellent long-term memory.
these are the only ones worth having.  and we're going to need them --
i know.  but you've never met.  it just seems like a stone unturned in your relationship with him.
well, anyway... sorry.
after he gets a blow job, he likes to have the cum spit back into his mouth while kissing. it's called snowballing.
take them, but i'm keeping a detachment of troops here to watch over them.
... he's an amazing officer.
lie down.
stacy, he's not a guy.  he's a little prick!
neither do i.
why?
i love you. come home.
oh, the best i ever had. absolutely the best.
oh, quiet, quiet, quiet.  say, tell me something did you read that speech you're gonna make tonight?
don't go in, ryan.
women have a curious taste for knickknacks. when i found out about ned--tried to make a break--lee wouldn't stand for it and--well--here i am!
not that he doesn't deserve to get fired... look!  cory's going for second!... sneaky!
i think not.  there'll be no hot time in this old town tonight.  you'll get a charge out of this.
what's she talking about?
then turn off the cartoon!
hey, i've got a situation here, in case you haven't noticed.
looks great.  it does.
then the son'a can establish a separate colony on this planet until we do...
not really.
i didn't say you did.
how come in former lifetimes, everybody was someone famous?  how come nobody ever says they were joe schmo?
yes, sir.
oh, two weeks, maybe three.
hey, ang'...
hello everyone.
honest?
hi, son.
you're in a tent, darling.  you're not at home.  and i can hear you very well if you just talk in a normal tone of voice.
it was all in czech wasn't it.
it's a pair of earrings.  i saw 'em in the mall one day, and i thought, damn, those would look good on those beautiful earlobes. so i bought 'em.  and i said to myself, next time erin says something nice, does something nice, i'll surprise her with 'em.  know how long ago that was?  six months.  in six months, you haven't said one nice thing to me.  that's a long time.
i know you both. enough. how much knowledge does it take before a man does something crazy.
so much for friends, then.  you're a bitter bastard, rob, you know that?
uuuuugh!
i intend to keep you alive, your majesty. so you can abdicate your throne and become my warlord.
slinky's in aisle five, twister's in aisle one, moon mud's in aisle four.
who is?
it's a gay cruise line, but i'll be, like, wearing a uniform and stuff.
nope.  no maps.  ocean, huh?  on vacation?
no. the disease was cut away from me. i will live. i will live.
what the hell do you think it was about?  there's nothing an unproved heir to the throne likes less than glaring competence in others.
i missed that one. or, hey, you know who else? morgan freeman. you know morgan?
me?
it looks like pixie dust...  kent would've given anything to see this.  david, too.
but... inside, i have seen-
you were saying you don't want a million dollars.
oh man...i don't know.  i'm gonna miss being disreputable.
no! this is my private property. according to california law we have a constitutional right to bear arms.
well, he's young and he's healthy.
as always.
ssshhh!  we say op.  covert					* operation.  and this one got a little rough.
you got a deal. 
i <i>was</i>...
i--i was wondering--is there anything you shouldn't eat--because of jungle fever?
what can i do? except maybe pass out?
or disinformation... if you wanted to, say, beam down a signal to send a ship off course? maybe one degree a minute?
i'm doing you folks a favor --
that was the telephone.
someone pop your balloon?
all right.
well, she... uh...
...not even music, nothing, no radios for the poles. but i'm sure you'll find work, wladek, a pianist like you.
mast?
well?
excuse me?
uh ... hi!  is this ... er ... joanne summerskill?
oh.  well, yes.  it's extraordinary.  you think you could sign it for us?
your mother used to baby-sit me when i was your age.  i bet you didn't know that.
nooo...  no!  stop!
of course.
professor, you guys gotta see this. dwight, come here.
but what if they find out... god, they'd put you in the gas chamber...
you know how it is, dad.  he's sort of under mother's thumb.
yearbooks always set you out for disappointment, i want mine to say: nick probably won't amount to much, so don't be surprised if you never hear anything about him again. can we go?...it smells like someone left their gym bag in here.
my math program. the superintendent said he'd fund it.
well, it's got huge ... very sharp ... it can jump a... look at the bones.
wait a minute.  wait a minute.
not her. me.    they're beautiful, aren't they? the stars. i never just look anymore and they're beautiful.
-- oh no, honey, i'll do that...
hmm.
luck, i guess.
did you know you have a wet spot on your shoulder?
no, not at all.
it's what i've learned.
i'm saying he asked me out for coffee, like a real date, when was the last time you did that?
it's okay, stanley. it's alright.
well, if you do, you'll let us know?
baby...you're asking the wrong guy.
a few days, ma'am.
sorry, di.  i was just going to my car.  i didn't mean to frighten you...
rogers, i don't think i will postpone doing something about you until i'm elected.  to start with, i'll break your neck.
yeah.
doctors lose patients sometimes. damn. i'm <u>still</u> in the dark: how'd he know about genesis?
see my nipples?
who knows?
quit stalling.  we'll miss the train.
did you shoot the rapids?
casy, won't you say a few words?
we don't have time to argue, susan.
what're you saying, charlie?
uni high tigers, sir. don't you remember ? i was captain of the team.
his secretary.  joanne braslow.
sorry about that... i just...
no.
twice...
hope i make it through both.
you're damn right!  i'm a child psychologist and you send me into a room with someone who could be a murderer!
what is?
are you glad?  i'm glad.
i asked my doctor. he said only another emotional shock could do it, and probably wouldn't. and you're not going to go diving off another rooftop to find out.
we won't let them.
yes it does.  don't you see?  we have to play by the rules.  that's what it wants.
what do you mean?
made you say it!
tell the jury how many people work in that office with you and mr. viznick.
stop busting my hump....
we want no quarrel with him.
i went out to delmar.
pest control, gotta do your apartment.
now ask him who his mother was.
close...
not a chance.  remind them that according to the geneva convention, firing on a civilian vessel on the high sea is an act of war.
soon as i finish the job.
and when i return... you and i shall have a little talk about showing proper respect!
oh, yes--they're fine people--regular people.
who are you?
i'm here to do my job.
be still ...
sounds like a bummer.
yeah.
then don't go to hollywood.
you'd think a guy who's taken on the job of saving the world would have a few more important things to do than traipse around after some girl.
i see you have people there. what are their names?
look closely.  that isn't writing. those are grooves.
switek pulling this off...?  that's not faith; that's delusional...
you're hot tonight, honey... but be quiet! shhhh! the kids!
he does.
but your people... neri... rocco; you don't think...
it's fine today, robert.
i know.
stop sounding stuffy. i'll take pictures from a jeep. from a water buffalo if necessary.
like, i've always wanted to walk on the moon.
paul... please, paul... listen to the reverend mother and do what she tells you.
answers.
look, mom, if i'm supposed to ever be this great leader, you should start listening to my leadership ideas once in a while.  'cause if you won't, nobody else will.
i learned it from listening to you! i hate you!
come on. you brought it up. do you know anything?
your dad must be really pissed.
"eight p.m. showtime, ninety-six admissions, receipts including concessions, $84.75... plus one fryer and two-dozen eggs."
did it occur to you they might find us?
we got em.  north...no, henry james was the novelist, frank james was a criminal...  yep, you came to the right place.  jessie james was the <u>brother</u>.  of the novelist, that's right.  that's alright susie.  see you tomorrow, susie.

there is nothing there.  not anymore.
been having bad dreams.
well, why don't you share them with us?
what's this?
ahh. perfect fit. the luxury of a hand-made shoe. as unique as a face or a fingerprint. or should i say dna?
i think i would.  and teach me to spit too. like a man. why should only men be able to spit. it's unfair.
no... i said "surrender in the name of the king of france"...
it's just us now.
i'm trying to slash my wrists.
wrong.  kuato's a mutant.  so don't get upset when you see him.

snoopy is about six inches taller than you.  i'm sorry, lee, you never had a chance.
where's craig?
ask the fbi.  they've got the terrorist playbook and they're running it, step by step.

maybe another drink first. more tequila?
a thousand times. he caught an uncatchable fish.
sarcastic, moi?  maybe i'll mellow when my ship comes in.  it's expected any day now.  i'm all packed and ready to go.

shep, no! he gets so excited when new people are here.
i thought maybe it might be for rachel banks.
thank you.  did you finish the upper field?
i know.
grant, you're sick!
...were you?
did i?  or was that you?  when you were hiding in the bathroom -- all conspiratorially like you were -- you became frightened, didn't you?  terrified.  like you were with the snake earlier -- and suddenly you have snakes slithering all over the floor.  you did that, norman.
yessir. none of the three had id on 'em but they're tellin' me all three is mexicans. was mexicans.
you think there was a connection to--
as the sun slowly sets in the west, we bid a fond farewell to the family of conch....
-- this is mr. laszlo.
it's the parents' fault really.
love demands it.
eighteen.  well, i'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
the blond...gruner. a killer.
did you get a doctor?
you were screaming like crazy.
fine.  this university will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your group's activities.
now you listen to me, lois lane, let it go. it's dead and buried. daddy took ol' yeller out behind the barn and shot him in the head a long time ago.
yeah, i know. it's great!
i guess so. i never thought of it that way.
when he returns, watch him.  when he leaves again, you tell me.
why didn't you do anything to stop her?
he said...
nobody else.
you got the wrong guy! she thinks i'm nick, i'm not!
i know what it's like to see ghosts that don't go away.  to be watching a scary movie in your head, whether you want to or not,  watching it alone.
not going to pole vault anywhere. that's for sure.
no girl? only biz, my dear artiste?
i couldn't believe it! i didn't think she was going to die. i knew she was sick...
no.
i am not asking for alms, but rather the ear of a kind man with a noble heart.
a beer?
... to prove something to myself... to prove i'm stronger than i think i am.
take it, damn it.
good idea.
nah, i need a place to stay. so how do you like being in college?
yes sir.
in my eyes, officer.
no, i guess not. it was pretty lousy of me, i guess, to be a child at the same time you were. not to stop being a child just because i had a child. i guess i was a real stinker not to be a grown-up when you needed a grown-up.
stressed.
just a guess. maybe they're not where they're supposed to be. maybe somebody moved them. habeas corpus -- no bodies, no crime, and nunez still plays as self defense. face it detectives... you have nothing.
i am serious.
no, it was a good thing.  i mean, good in that it was very quick.
i don't know.  what do you call a blind dinosaur?
yeah, you gonna be there?
who is he?
i never cared about that.
do you smell shit?
they're on me. they're smoking me out!
thank you. let go, there's a good nurse.
after all, that's how you catch fish, isn't it?
it's pink.
not bad.
pity.  people are so earnest nowadays.
oh, she did, huh?  when i come up i'll show you how saturday night got invented.
at least not anymore.
get mitch cohn on the phone in new york, tell him she's breaking her contract and we're very up...
i hear you're meeting with the studio lawyers to get out of your contract.
for what?
george just never really...aimed that high.  even with not hitting a rabbit.  i knew you were doing that, by the way. that's why i stopped doing it with you. you were no fun.  it was always like you were frightened.  quiet and boring.
no. i'm sore.
he saved mrs. halpern? please, the twisted fuck.
i know it can't be easy.  life hasn't changed that much for reed, sue and johnny.  at least they can go out in public.  but for you?  people staring. whispering behind your back...
you're sure...
go home, mulder. it's late.
i'm not going to hurt you! i promise! please!
but i thought-
i think his family wants this kept quiet.
if you fuck me on this one, i'll spare no expense.
that's absurd.
i didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, dignan.
yes.  franklin, you can't live there anymore.  with mama and shirly and kittykat.  you have to go away.
they were gonna!  but some asshole sent a lot of money to give jason and his mother a decent burial. now look, you just lie down and get some rest.  in the morning i'll call that clinic and see if they...
no. i don't.
i must take you to an emergency ward sometime--on a saturday night. that's also fun.  i came to see selma, as a matter of fact.
i know, i know.
why should you?
listen--
i hear you. i'll catch you in a bit. feeling cooped up in there, you know?
no problem.
go fuck yourself.
smoke it!
your surprise, chet. her name is lil.
we had a team at the 325th evac last fall. i coached the boys myself.
goosed!
no.
i'm not wrecking the transmission!
please, i insist.
it certainly is.
jesus.
yaay!
well stay for tonight, then.
she was raised on a poor dirt farm. i'm sure she's never seen a dentist or hardly even a doctor.
listen, i gotta problem. this girl ain't feelin' well, y'know -- the doctor says she should exercise, y'know once in awhile an' ice skatin' is the best thing --
robert, grace isn't adjusting to school. and she can't sit in this apartment all day... i think it would be good for her.
then you do it.
your usual table, sir?
good point.
i wanted to apologize for being nasty to you this evening.
petra, this ain't about the people that sent us here, you know that.
look, jeffrey, you don't really kidnap someone that you're acquainted with.  you can't get away with it if the hostage knows who you are.
i know god help me, i know that, eli.  but i tell you that if he's found here, the people who did this to him will come for samuel.
by herself. that big mandingo nigga winston ain't there, is he?
oh, see, studying would've been a huge help. where were you, then?
into the clouds and behind the mountains.
turn over your weapon, edna!
neither do i.
ah, i can smell it on you.
they say love is blind. do you think that's true?
...aven't you?
please understand. if you go this way, you'll never get to your ship. the police know about lathrop wells. we have to go another way. i'll get you to your ship. i promise.
yeah.  you want to go dancing tonight?
isn't tonight the night you are going to do it with mike?
don't worry. i'm prepared for anything.
yes.  you can enjoy some wonderful views from there.
how?
yes, you can make sandwiches....
because that's where he burned them up, the child laborers from his mills!  because that's where their bones are!  he killed <i>hundreds</i>.  he took them here and he killed them.  their bones are in the fireplace!
a homosexual scandal, you mean? for me to answer a question of that magnitude, you'll have to remove both your shoes and your socks.
what? how do you know that?
well, if he hasn't, i'm vastly mistaken.
skin has to touch skin.  that's the requirement for the warrant.  then he makes a credible excuse and he stops....  her crew blackmailed and asset- stripped the last mark down to his social security...
i thought you were divorced.
well, okay.  i'll take you about nine-thirty in the morning.  that's okay with you?
oh no, really.  she has her book.
gotta run. shipment of grub worms coming in first thing.
don't start thinking about it.  is the tape off?
sure, pop. whatever you want.
on earth -- no.  but on krypton we could slice him up like oscar mayer bologna.
me too.
you don't like seeing people get hurt. now in morality, that is a virtue. in politics, however, that is weakness.  you were a hostage to everyone else *                    long before you were a hostage to
wait!  there's a nice little one over there!
yeah.
i don't know.  they've hurt the unicorn.
what's her address?  where does she live?
they're not your friends... they've held you back... kept you from your destiny...
our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking.
mr. nixon.
oh, angela! go with these trappers! they'll lead you safely down the mountain...
i don't think so.
... why, yes, he is... is your leg feeling any better?
did i kill a guy named benito?
you don't know the half of it.
yeah.
harry...
i guess not.
so i just heard her cries for help and all that, and when i went downstairs there were already those other people there, so i just stood around really, waiting -- you know how people do -- and then when your colleagues arrived i came back upstairs. and that's about all, i think. i didn't actually see anything useful, i don't think.
this is the last chapter.  please, please give me clearance.  it's for science.
no... they said she was here...
yes.
aye.
nevertheless, you could have mentioned the sauce.  well, i see you have a camera.
well, i wonder why.
oh my god! why did you tell me you only slept with three guys?
we're not certain...
what about that girl?
call up the people at j. walter thompson.  set up an appointment at four.
jesus, it's a real gash, isn't it?
don't be un-neighborly-like, herman -- don't forget he done us a little ol' favor.
thank you -- i've worked hard to become so.
wow.   congratulations.
it appears, sir, that someone has stolen the batsignal.
a real shame.
i'll get you there all right.
really?
what is he doing here?
ahh, she will be yours.
such a brief visit, but dear child, it has made my christmas very merry.
the plane is in at seven, so i'd say about eight.
nonsense, mr. president - i thank you for coming to spend time with a dying man.
the police won't find your car.
hi.  it's me.  i got a favor to ask you.
nah...
well, bill -- mind if i call you bill?  let me be frank. i've made a lot of money. i've got my own business in detroit. rivets. i make rivets and sell them to fisher body.  well, rivets, you know, can get pretty boring after a while. when my business manager told me i should shelter some money, i thought i'd try this.
i don't think so...
tell me.  just start at the beginning.
if he runs, everyone will assume he took the money.
i'll tell you what i'm going to do.
look, i think we should work things out.
i just tell it like it is, mister.  if i'm getting on your nerves, though, you might want to think about hiring me.
i rode here, on my horse.
hiya.
i'm glad you like it.
no way, there's nothing you can do to help me.
the ball is in richter's court.  but we're sure as hell not going to sit on our hands while he assassinates people--we're gonna stop the son-of- a-bitch!
well, and it's pretty cool too, ya know?  bein' here together an all...
that's cool.
yes... i remember...
what about me?
ah, go chase yourself. i'll take my business elsewhere. and for future reference, you are no longer welcome at ray's boom-boom room.
you not ugly.
i saw the light.  i thought maybe you were up.
...yeah, okay.
i understand.
a undercover cop has got to be marlon brando. to do this job you got to be a great actor. you got to be naturalistic. you got to be naturalistic as hell. if you ain't a great actor you're a bad actor, and bad acting is bullshit in this job.
buzz me the minute she comes in.
two hours.
wing to cruise configuration... full impulse power.
where are the tapes, graham?
it's always the same whenever someone new comes into his life -- freddie, fausto, peter smith-kingsley -- he's wonderful -- did you meet him, he's a musician? -- ...and especially you, of course... and that's only the boys.
she wouldn't let me.  she's the only reason you're alive.
i couldn't let you wear black on sailing day, sweetpea. it's bad luck.
just looking around.
i don't want to.
you was insulted, but you don't know it.
why should they call us back?
how dare you?!  nobody shuts up rita but me!
i mean breakfast.
you're right.
you betrayed me!
not like the others -- dean, mccord, the rest ... we never got our side of the story out, al.  people've forgotten.  i mean: "fuck you, mr. president, fuck you tricia, fuck you julie!" and all that shit, just words, but what violence!  the tear gassing, the riots, burning the draft cards, black panthers -- we fixed it, al, and they hate me for it -- the double dealing bastards.  they lionize that traitor, ellsberg, for stealing secrets, but they jump all over me 'cause it's nixon.  ... they've always hated nixon.
czar peter gave it to his wife, catherine the great. for it he sold ten thousand serfs in the market.
tell me what she wore.
it's real.  i'm telling you, it's real.
bermann!
james, where did you grow up?  was it around here?  around baltimore?
absolutely -- you're clearly very busy.
i didn't hear you.
they must be shielded somehow.  i'm sure the base is there.
i know, it was chaos; but anyway, here i am one week late.  this is for my mama.  you remember merle?
you're close, crash, you want me to run you?  i'll run you!
christ, you're right -- gray makes jerry ford look like mozart.  just have helms call him.  helms can scare anybody.
...yeah....well you have me now.
look, i don't know what you been told 'bout section gangs, but how 'bout seein' me sometime?
int. andy's ice cream factory/andy's office - day. 
yeah, he said it was routine too. now it's two guys saying it's routine.
more light and light, more dark and dark our woes.
i'm telling you your life!
i've finished my circle and i haven't picked up any life read- ings.
but -- who -- what --?
you deserve a lot better. and i'll tell you what we'll do. stay and play nurse, as you say--and if certain things happen i'm taking everybody up with me, and you'll get one of the biggest jobs in washington.
i love you.
he's just pushy.
you was in the marines, huh?
lina, come here!
it's a league record.
yes mam...
i was right behind you, but you're too dumb to turn around.  if he turned around he might get dizzy and fall down.
you don't want to be a public nuisance, do you?
what about eric?
you don't know what i'm thinking.
stick with me, kid.  looks big when you get here but you can cover it in five minutes.
do you miss mallory?
see me in my office.
like last night, veronica?
nothing to do with dad. it's me, actually.
i gotta go.  i'll see you at work.  walter, you scared me.  don't ever do that again.
oh.
yeah, it won't take long and besides you sassy poodle girls will slow us down.
bulbs burned out, nobody bothered to replace 'em.
and on to a bigger one with you?
we'll have every leprechaun in ireland here honey.
stanzi-manzi-banzi-wanzi!
this way, sir.
and they're all locked together in here... and he won't let go of them!
we could...
much better.
well i'm overjoyed.
some people don't think it's healthy.
you're not death.  you're just a kid in a jacket and a pair of pants.
ju1ien was your father   your great-grandfather - your grandfather - and your father. all one in the same...  that is why he fought carlotta for your life.
films mainly.
he's the boss of all the bosses, and i respect him.
a visual record, yes.  a before-and- after kind of thing.  this could make your reputation.
this place is an untapped resource. check it out, dude, these vocal jazz girls are <u>hot</u>.
amanda finch. her ex is one of the wealthiest businessmen in detroit. play your cards right and you could hit paydirt. she like 'em young.  and since you look a little new at this, let me give you three words of advice. hard to get. think it, act it, know it, be it. nothing a woman loves more than when you beat her at her own head games.
i'm just kidding.
you take some awful chances.
that's great dad.
i thought all our colonial scouts were in the militia?
god saw to it to put you in my path. and i aim to cure ya of your wickedness.
i'm born-again.
my father was an electrician. already forgot that?
that's a long time.
yes, sir... but, do you have these?
i did. and then maybe get the jacket and what have you...
no... i guess not.
hey, you!
it's nothing. he's just got a sense of humor, that's all.
he knew nothing. he just didn't care.
i don't know.
well, if it's as serious as all that—we'll move heaven and earth to—
she lived on the plume.  you never know.
from what i understand, it's pretty much whatever we want.
i don't know nothin'!
too bad.  what did your father do?
cherry-red tears, your first book. i read it at least nine times.  and then i found out you were going to attend some kind of book fair.
those blood suckers. how i'd love to fix those babies but—
why not? i'm going to have her for a lifetime.
this seems a little sophisticated for them.  these are not subtle guys.
in a word, yes.
he frightened you and he hurt you. it's not your fault. it's his fault. tell us who he is so we can find him. stop him from doing this to other women.
the f.b.i. has nothing remotely similar to this guy.  i think he's a first- timer.
what do you think?  heart attack?
the point is, they are paying for information.  real information.  not tooth paste brands.  not whether he wads of folds his toilet paper.  and no 16 hours of recorded phone sex. you are wasting everyone's time with this shit.
that's impossible. i told them jacks died of a sudden heart attack, probably brought on by over drinking.
yes --
i have.
can we see?
ready to go.  who signs for him?
what?
oh, god, dion.
it's just as well to tell you--because if we're going to get off on the right foot--i mean--in case i act sort of strange--it's the suit.
yeh, but i don't know where he is.
if i flinch when you say you love me, it's both our problems. my confusion becomes your confusion. students confuse teachers, patients confuse psychiatrists, lovers with confused hearts confuse lovers with clear hearts....
like in the parson's tale, and dante.
not blue enough.
impersonally.
you weren't so bad yourself.
daddy, how come that coffin's so small?
... and me.  no, that's be me and me.  is that what i said?
so if it ain't staring us in the face, it's got to be retroperitoneal. and that, along with the look of the wounds, makes me figure he's got a hole in his sigmoid colon that we won't find unless we look for it.
yeah, i know. back to the eiffel tower.  and what about you?
i will not touch the white man's poison: his drugs, his liquor, his carrion, his women.
-- to fight?  we'll see...
the things that get you excited.
that's fucked up. yo, i heard he was jerkin' off.
i am.
he <u>can't</u> help you now, honey!
into what?
trust me.  even checked 'em with my own eyes.
not if the people change together in relation to that love.
look, i don't have time to fuck around.  there's somebody out there i don't need to see.  you got a fire escape or anything?
i don't look like no possum!
i would call it-- unforgivable.
yeah, but he still has the aggravation. three days sitting in a cell.
don't be callous.
-- mulder! get in the car!
mr. san pedro sula is from honduras.
i'm... i'm doing a very special thing here. and you can't even ... respond?
hurry up and get dressed.
ah, the mafia, the cops; do i know how to party or what?
fired?
you're insane.
breaking left!
you have to leave -
maybe the feds got it.
i have a confession to make.  someone gave me six-hundred dollars to spill drinks on you, as a practical joke.
you mean god said, "i need you, jeanne?"
my...my neck.  my...my neck.  perfect?  oh -- bang on my chest if you think i'm perfect.  go ahead -- bang on it!
no.
yes.
i live in notting hill.  you live in beverly hills.  everyone in the world knows who you are.  my mother has trouble remembering my name.
castle couer de noir built with magic... simple as death... strong as hate...
mathieu. colonel mathieu.
i didn't mean to...
yeah, i was there.
but if someone miniaturized the process...
yes.
i'm real upset about what you wrote.
should i call you back?
can you give me a drink, please?
oh no.
where's the girl?
doped up kids all over town.  park was full of them last night.  very easy pickin'.  goetz's type.
where are they?
epps?
i cut it on an old rusty knife.
yeah.
call me -- do you know -- would you -- would you like to call me by my first name?
sssshhh. she's resting.
i want to know who you are.
what about howard?
then after that it's safe.
i know...
is he a bad man? norbu says he is "lavish" and "willful". "how can he give you monk's vows if he has not kept them himself?"
hello, rob.  remember me?  i'm ray. ian.
i only wanted to see as others do... feel as others do...  ...but marguerite could not help me.  nor julien...
i liked him.
"...are close to naming the man they believe actually killed jimmy chin"?
i'm only human, rumors to the contrary. and i'm as curious as the next man...
well, i didn't know they was a secret club.
i've gone this far, and right now i think i'm in better shape than you.
no, thank you.
would you hold on just a minute here, please? look, there's no reason to panic now. epps saw somebody. fine. it's a big boat.  chances're real good he doesn't even know about the gold. if we stay cool, nobody'll be the wiser.  the gold stays where it is til we're ready to go. like i said, it'll be a hell of a lot safer there than here.
claire.
he was very understanding - you ought to talk to him ... algeria?
well -- this year -- if it's good i plan to make it a tradition. uh, my it certainly is beautiful --
what's he holding?
looks like enough for six impor- tant pictures.
have you ever stolen anything?
you don't understand. the wedding bands. the wedding bands are in my wallet.
oh good! we haven't seen an anastasia in several days!
what did you want to happen?
excuse me?
i threw that filthy thing away -- i don't know what you're trying to prove with it, but --
well, i think it's important for people to know that the world is in danger.
yes, i understand.
none of that matters.  our communications equipment's been destroyed.  if your radio and satellite phone were in those trailers that went off the cliff, and i'm guessing by the look on his face --
they drive so recklessly there.
no.  that is, i bet it turns out i've heard your name a million times, only you know how it is -
no--don't do it. i'm sure. the truth is, diz--there's no man i've seen yet or--must be something wrong with me. i've been feeling low for weeks.
four?
i can't.
why did you give up teaching?
back home, we call him the miracle worker.
i don't know.  it doesn't even matter anymore.  i just want you to be happy... it's not that i don't love you either.  but jimmy, your timing couldn't be worse.
how much?
not when you're up here with the gold, i guess not.
that's in maverick county.
...his majesty was quite keen that you should understand --
this evening we must do something special by way of a farewell.
i can check and call you back.
...and let me say again for the tenth time...  ...you people were quite ready for the merger. you declared yourselves... fully agreed on all the terms -- why should the signing of these articles be suddenly held up?
you like it?
yes, sir.
could i be known as paul muad'dib?
nobody knows anything, believe me.
we toil and labor, we loot and pillage, rape and kill... and yet...
"how'd we ever get such in a ru-utt"
maybe it is! how the fuck would you know?! you don't know a fucking thing! you can't get scared, can you get angry?!
do they close up every year for this processionist business?
more to the point. where's our host?
possible atmospheric condition, sir...solar.  it's unusual, but no cause for alarm.  intelligence reports the soviets are having the same problem.
come on. i want you. you're mine. you're mine! come on!
you must be chilled to the bone, standing out of doors like this.
been putting my files into it. you take sugar and milk?
do you know where i found this?
jesus, you are persistent.  okay, your friend was right. gracie is not only pregnant, she is very pregnant... at noon tomorrow -- in what is sure to be a media circus -- the whales get shipped out.
almost eight. you wouldn't believe how weird i look naked.
sooner--if you like.  see you again, i hope.
well, i'm goin' all over, layin' money out of my own pocket, and i never get anything back. what the hell's goin' on?
calm down, please. this man needs help and you need protection from him. that's obvious.
you better believe it.
yes--well--uh--that's another one of those statements which more or less automatically requires an apology.  whenever you feel like it. it's sort of like turning off an alarm clock that's ringing loudly. your apology turns off the alarm.
why do they tell little kids that?
just that rob seems to think it would be wiser to start a record label by putting out a record with business- crippling nazi youth shoplifters than with someone he knows in his bitter jealous heart is a musical visionary.  that's all.
they only took electrical appliances.
whatever our name is.
now that i'm seeing someone, it's a whole other thing.
okay.
i can't do that. not while the joker's still at large.
--can we use their names?--
i was a mistake.
i refer to your new and unpregnant understudy. eve harrington.
alright. i'll think about it.
thank you.
anything else you don't want me to know?
at the half moon.
we'll find him.
starling -
hey.  it's liz.
i'm on my way back in. over.
must be a real soft pillow.
we shoulda been there already and we woulda been if it hadn't been for your fuckin' around!
why am i great?
yes.
it's possible isn't it?
thanks, but -- oh, i don't think so. it's been kind of a discouraging evening.
come on, don't me give a hard time. i'm just trying to make the place look nice for katka.
never mind where... get outta here... i mean it, sailor.
is she fair, this princess?
depends on the state.
the workmen must have a trunk - don't stop, cherie -
can we put rebecca lawson at the scene?
i'm still not clear on chaos.
only in mutual advantages -- moreover...
robin.
no... no, it's so... empty... please... give it back... i need it...
it's not what i heard.
we do.  she's got hers, we've got ours. hey. wash and dries.
let your fingers do the walking.
maybe god has let everybody who ever lived be reborn--so he or she can see how it ends.  even pithecanthropus erectus and australopithecus and sinanthropus pekensis and the neanderthalers are back on earth--to see how it ends. they're all on times square--making change for peepshows.  or recruiting marines.
yes.
jody, wait.
don't be shitty.
hey, you didn't fuck it up with me.  you know that.  it was my fault, babe, it really was.  and you know i'm sorry. and i'm sorry to see you upset now.  i hate to see you in pain like this.
what's this?
i guess she and i read the same gossip columns.
my uncle's in the war office. he said, don't go on the bomb sites. "boys are going missing all the time."
i don't know what to say.
yes. yes. let me out!
not good enough, scotty. you've got to do better!
sal's alive???
and this jeremy--
do you hear me, sir!  if you ever fall... into british hands...  what white water?
hi! star.
he was a moocher, a card cheat, a country-club golf hustler. a scumbag... chasing dentists for a few bucks.
ow...
i've never had a pedicure before.
you can all go home, now.  he's not going anywhere.
well, thanks.
hnnrr.  -- like to masturbate.  shit once a day.
audrey, listen, i need help. i know it's late and i shouldn't be calling you like this – believe me i wouldn't have if i could see any other alternative, but i – i'm sorry - listen, how are you – i'm sorry. you doing okay?
i'm not doing anything wrong. i'm just trying to have a good time. do i have to be cooped up in the house all the time?
you'll pay for this, marvin a. pickles!  i'm turning your file over to the vice-squad!!  the prosecution rests, your honor.
what do you mean?  mommy? you're scaring me!
it's okay. they pre-order. there's a choice of three entrees.
i'm sorry, i'm afraid i have no idea what you're saying right now.
a triumph.  when did you get here?
i won't be made to feel like i've done something wrong.
the steering committee.
i wish i had an answer.  evil is powerful, more so every day it seems.  but i believe the worst for you and for this house is behind us.
we're ghosts.
are you treadstone?
good day to our brothers-in-arms. have you come to join us?
we're all on the same hajj now.
want to what?
alan?!
jesus!
well, what do we do? we drove all the way out here.
now, my dear boy. you shouldn't—
marylin was friends with howard and amanda doyle. they don't like the way you operate. they helped her.
nah.
we've been waiting fifteen minutes—
that's over fifty-thousand dollars profit per kilo.
suga.  go ahead and get us something to smoke on.
i'm not through. this will come as a shock. again, to one of you. i am catwoman. the catwoman.
carson dyle is dead.
what?  running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat...
they'll start to soon enough.
reach what?
i don't know. maybe they'll like it.
any change?
i'm not at liberty to say. sometimes it's just routine, sometimes there's been a complaint. we'll be in touch.
agreed.  you have the momentary advantage, sir.  but i will see you smile from the yard arm, sir.
there is no alternative.
i wuz leaving anyway, for good.
really?
absolutely.
they're a finesse team...
what responsibilities?
but i've seen him!
it's not impossible.
they arrived, can you believe it?
you want to make me look like him...
who?
barely.
fun.
you gonna write me a check?
just thinking if this is really the right thing for us.
no, i don't really mean it. well, i mean, this is our last chance to think about it. how 'bout you, bama?
i don't know. and i don't care, kevin's a jerk and i don't like him anymore. he's all yours!
come on.  let me buy you something to eat.  looks like you could use the company.
gump, is it?
you said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape?
are your pants off?
i didn't say it bothered me.
fundoscopic examination is unrevealing in these cases!
seriously, buffy.  that look was way twisted.  what were you thinking about?
...wow...
does she want to be?
huh?  oh.  uh... pears
that's all right.
found in asia!
alcohol does horrible things to a developing young mind.
get out of here!
just sit me up.  nice and tall. bring benjamin first.
hey, there's no reason to use that kind of language!
paul!
caesar, i'm leaving.
no. i'll take the other one.  right. well it's good to have you back. see you tomorrow, probably.
five thousand dollars.
thanks.  say, she's quite a character, that norma desmond.
all right.  i'll try.
hey-
i have been... i think you're right.
how's that?
it's from hunger.
surprise me.
no, you didn't.
what, nervous i'm going to win?
bon voyage.
why not?
oral hygiene?
what was you saying?
what are you gonna do? look at me, nicky! i got no legs, i got no hips, i got one ear...
five point two.
well, i thought he'd come in the middle.
mrs...
nay.  you've not reckoned with the powers of faerie medicine.
now?
over eight years of some of the hardest raging experiences of my life.
on accounta you, sonrisa didn't get to buy off the jury, or kill the judge. he's gone.  once and for all.  it was war, max, and you won.
just so you know: i'm not going back until i understand what it is.  i am going to figure out what it is, make it stop, and then i will go home.
you just blew up a house in paris! this program is over.  call it off.
yeah?
just an expression man, don't mean nothin'.
god damn it, you fucking virgin prick--step outside.
i'm alright.  will you stay home for awhile?
[the boss did or his brother.]
you're a young man.  you're romantic.  you think a pretty face and a clean conscience go together. you think a soft voice means a soft heart.  you'll grow out of that.
they were walking along the fence past the soccer field.  said they were curious about the school so i invited them to the meeting.
uh-huh. and where's the press galery?
i'm sick of playing. i've got a better idea.
no.  no.  mom wants you to come to the funeral.  it's on friday.
what about your personal safety in the meantime? what about the army -- and the police?
yes.
howard is a beautiful person.
do you intend to enlist without my permission?
-- in magazines nobody reads.
where?
thank you for calling the white house...
maybe you're right. i should look on the bright side. i mean, i've still got my health...  i'm out of here. i've got to get up at six a.m. to move my boss's brother into his apartment.
extra?
why would i do that?
yes, captain. it needed our mortality, the fear of it, our struggle against it, our fears, our dreams...
committed.
it's very convincing.
his name was meng si zhao.  he was a brother to li mu bai by oath. one day, while in battle, he was killed by the sword of li mu bai's enemy.  after, li mu bai and i went through a lot together.  our feelings for each other grew stronger.  but how could we dishonor meng's memory?  so the freedom you talk about, i too desire it.  but i have never tasted it.
that's coming along well!
no!
but that's what we're here to find out, right?
it's your best play, nicky.
priests keep pretty tight mouthed then?
i don't want to.
maybe they are.  maybe this is all part of the package.  the building of the machine has demanded international cooperation on an unprecedented scale.  maybe requiring us to come together in this way was, in effect, part of the plan.
sqeaky! no way, she ain't that hot.
risk is part of the game if you want to sit in that chair.
don't come any closer for a sec.  this is gonna be kind of a shock... you remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
that's a wolf's head.
yeah.
shells and lobsters and stuff?
just what the hell do you think you're doing?
i do.  and i practice with them. at least three hours a day.
you could have worn one of those big, floppy woman's easter sunday hats.
i like that about me, beautiful.
you do this -- for friendship?
just as well, lenny.  you gotta get past it.  i mean sure, faith was by far the most outstanding woman a guy like you could ever hope to get, i mean it's completely and deeply humiliating that she's gone, but it's over, campadre.
i kill chimera at biocyte and he's sitting on a cure without a disease.
the police station.
what does he mean by "target audience"?
hey, man, i'm down too, you know.
cute. tell me you wouldn't want to go out again. after all the talking we've been doing.
i mean, what do you want?  what are you doing hanging around here.
no, there's no evidence of a surge or spike of any kind. it's as if time just... stopped for seven years.
jack oberfeld in person.  did you kill him?
market crashes.  bomb drops. greenhouse effect affects.  we'll still be the richest, most powerful people in the world.  in 1992, europe is coming together to become one business superpower.  it's one party we'd love to poop.
someone was at that window. i saw the curtain move.
thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy personality.
you sayin' you'll do what?
thirty-eight...simulated.
i know...  but you do look so silly.
this about the justice department?  they laid on a tour for tomorrow a.m.  told me to wear a tie.  you like this one?
what do maniacs always want?
so i stay. stay until i hustle up enough to play fats again. maybe by that time i'll develop myself some character.
and you can depend on me, son. trust me.  whatever comes we'll face it together, i swear.
these men have suffered but i believe they will fight.
if we lived at any previous time in human history we wouldn't even have the option of failing -- we'd have to wonder our whole lives, unable to do anything about it.  this time, right now, is unique in our history, in any civilization's history -- the moment of the acquisition of technology.  the moment when contact becomes possible.  we've already beaten incredible odds by being lucky enough to be alive now.
who's got the car keys?
no, your mother did, then i did after she passed.
your timing is excellent, mr. scott. you've fixed the barn door after the horse has come home. how much refit time till we can take her out again?
whoo!
what'd you feel when you kissed him?
mr. ola's just leaving, kay. please tell the senator i won't be a minute.
that's what i said eighteen months ago.
we want you to go to college, find a career you love, marry a nice girl from a nice family, and live happily ever after.
where's my bag?
yes, i have seen that show on television.
is that your real name? really?
no...
i guess he's still on the road. what kind of show is this?  are they some negroes in it without being buffoons?
okay.
who you calling dumb, dickless?
if there's anything we can do for you, dr. mimms. we want to help.
i do development for tv movies.
danny's gonna be out for blood the next time.
garry's missing!
don't be an idiot!  you're in no fit state to go anywhere.
it's a mouse trap.
it was fucking '60 minutes ii'!  i couldn't say no!  i could've been the next diane sawyer!
goodnight.
we're family, caesar.
you mean you want us to make copies of yentl, fiddler on the roof, and chaim potok's the chosen?
no, that's right -- i know that.  she said she's using another name -- but the problem is she left the message with my flatmate, which was a serious mistake.
i'm afraid this meat is overdone.
a guy who calls himself armitage.
no. no. i don't have a... no. it was from a client.
do what?
the slush fund at creep financed the ratfucking, we've almost got that nailed down, so--
by whose authority?
something maybe grew a size bigger.
how the hell should i know?
pre-australian, actually. but i'd dig goin' to california. i'm california dreamin'.
i got it. thank you.
as i said, a worshipper of snakes, and of smoke, and flames.
i'll grow a moustache by the time you get out of here.
she says it's for the times when he's good to her. she's lonely since daddy died. she said sometimes she don't know why.  he threatened to kill her if she ever left him. my daddy would kill him if he was here and somebody was mean to mama. vaughan, he's real good to mama. vaughan that you met. but he's not able to do anything to doyle, he's funny you know. not funny ha, ha, funny queer. he likes to go with men instead of women. that makes him not to be able to fight too good. he sure is nice though. he's from st. louis. people who are queer can get along better in a big town. he got transferred here to work. but mama said the real reason he left is 'cause his daddy hated him. for bein' the way he is. i wish he liked to go with women. i'd rather him be mama's boyfriend than doyle.
well, i can't, sweetheart.
can you imagine that brain in this body?
i didn't like her, angie. i don't feel like calling her up.
yeah. just had a little dream. i'm falling right back to sleep.
stand up and see for yourself.
do you know how much it costs to go to new york?
lewis...
i never knew that music like that was possible.
thanks, man.  i've been hating myself for the last two days.
i think christmas brings out the worst in people.
i'll come inside with you, if you like, but mr. crawford said you'd probably want to be alone.
i am alone in the world.
i promise.
barnes didn't know.  couldn't get a reading.
thank you.
well, that's fine --
people come here to catch bass and to get laid at the boy's town in cuidad leon--
not a lot.
i don't know whether to chill you and serve with cottage cheese, or rip you open and eat you right here.
i'm just in one of my moods. you know how i get.
tommy, take a walk.
i came to tell you what a swell guy i think you are to do this--
well, i... as they say in your century -- i don't even have your phone number. how will i find you?
have i?
senior exec.
well, i don't know. he don't need any trouble from you.
but you didn't know she was at my place last night when you were. she came there for the letters of transit. isn't that true, ilsa?
not to me.
granger and pitts have one hell of a caseload... and i would have thought with jetson here being the first newcomer plainclothes, and hubley's body being found over in the newcomer community...
what are you doing in here?
there is a very simple way. got a telephone book?
what is this?
just go!
it's got a name.  copper ridge. there used to be a copper mine near here.
all right, brad, all right - you don't have to be a war correspondent unless you want to - i'd want to.  hello, georgie.
yeah, it was funny, it was very funny.  but the show was about the two frenchmen, now that was funny and it was warm.
the extortion, the threats ...
thought you didn't believe his story.
like what you're doing. i'm not going to eat you up.  i need your help, and if you keep staring at me like that. i might start screaming.
plotting our new course.
back and upper corridors.
what about us? what about me?
you are passionate, mozart! but you do not persuade.
he just tried to save him!
right.  that's why you tried to kill me.
not for seven more minutes.
c'mon, man, not in front of the baby. put on your seat belt before i get another ticket.
daddy -- stop it!
you mind me asking: why the fuck?
maybe i should read it.
yes mother.
keep talking.
someone sent that message. admiral, you have to put me on that ship.
or maybe it will trap me inside for all eternity.
gently, son --
that land belongs to the strongest.
yeah.
okay, plan b.
you've got to go.
hah.
yes, yes--the air--  --i'm getting plenty of air.  miss marsh--mrs. rosson.
god, it's so totally pathetic.
shut up!
i am afraid of nothing.
you mean what's left of us.  yeah i'm running on empty anyways. gotta refuel.
i gave up on you.
the miracle kid.
yes sir.
yes, sweetheart, shh.
what'm i gonna do with half a cent? buy me a thoroughbred cockroach?  everybody loses them fractions?
i did. first and only blow. so far.
clear enough, moneypenny. this should present no significant problem.
munro would. but general webb will not send their soldiers across the salt lake.  having let them go, i fear i will only fight the same men again when i move south.  and yet, i cannot break the terms of the capitulation and sully the lilies of france...
minnie pearl.
my father always degraded me.  killed my self-esteem.  and my mother was blind.
we're going to have to go back out there.
fewer will survive them.
well, i hope you’re not too heartbroken and...
you gonna get rough now, threaten me? i make good by tomorrow or get my legs broken?
i thought i'd gotten off the main...
you own this place?
what's on your mind?
you found all this, all this out on one date?
wait a minute ... everything you asked for is on the way ...
let me call the school -- tell them not to let her go.
uh huh...
i sort of do. but i only see it as a fantasy version of reality. cleaned up enough to be erotic.
... and i have inquiries out to doctors, experts in the field ... there is, of course, a problem getting a doctor to testify that another doctor's negligent ...
tippecanoe and tyler, too!
she looks in her purse...
very clever.
superman gets mail here?
this is not the way to treat people.
it's about time. isn't fun great?
me neither. nothing too exciting. so tell me, to what do i owe the honor?
sure.
what's to see?
farrah fawcett?! who's gonna play my brother? is jason priestly available?
the cusp of my life.  what i was, what i am, what i will be ... past, present, future, all bound here at this timeless moment of decision.  i was an explorer of forbidden vices and pleasures. opening the box was my final act of exploration, of discovery.
hey, bud.
yellow pages.  v for veterinarian. there aren't that many.
we'll cover your escape!
flower girl.
come here.
i hope you don't have any doubts about that.
yeah.  guy's got some serious sex fantasies.
tell me your name.
she'd invaded my support groups, now she's invading my home.
that sounds kind of pessimistic.
here, lester.
i appreciate you looking out for me.
the one that left you?
see my mother?
won't it be rather embarrassing for a soviet envoy to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them?
thanks. um, this is ken cortland, my husband.
then stop, 'cause that's where we're going.
all right, virge, your call.  but give doc the shotgun.  they'll be less apt to get nervy if they see him on the street howitzer.
yes.
all the time.
a crazy madman.
i'm sorry but it's been a crazy evening. i'm going to make that place into something big. god, i love you!
you mean alex.
why not? after all, i got stuck with a railway ticket. i think i'm entitled to know.
not even close.
they spurred onto high ground, my lord, full of spirit and looking for the zulu. full of sport they were, my lord.

there may be jobs where you can disappear for days at a time, but this isn't one of them.  here, if you don't do the work, you don't get to stay.
benjamin -- i'm not trying to seduce you. i wish you'd --
illusions, madam?
why not?
i didn't ask for this.
unfortunately no, these americans are smart, they pay me only half now, half when i get them back to cairo, so i must go all the way.
oh yeah?  where's the bed?
you seem tense.  is everything all right?  you feel okay?
screw the rules.  i’m talking about the choice.
i don't like do-it-yourself cuisine. buffets.  salad bars.
that can wait till the weekend.
now.  if we can get it into the boat, we won't have to blow it up -- we can just eject it into space.
well, i don't know how you got a ticket for --
hiding what?
oh, and did you hear he booked another fan appearance without us?
i was going to let you out, eventually, cassius. i swear.
and it now belongs to you, according to baltus.  i heard him say it.
i guess it was a little too inconvenient. so for fourteen years, this stuff flowed into the groundwater, free as you please.
let it go.
well, you'll have a ball. you seem to have everything everybody wants when they go back. the car, the suit, the watch. the look. that just leaves the little things, like happiness, character, point of view...
i'll be up soon, little chief.
to frame him, obviously.  you got to get in your minds how the hell spooks think, bill!  they're not ordinary crooks.
but you was going to fight for me.
all right.  it was...
be nice. that thing saved my life.
don't worry.  we're not gonna film any of it.
no, i don't think so. i --
no...  it's all right. i got it. don't worry about it.
in the bag underneath.
damn.
here we go!
so it's mr clean. wise up, jack, this whole business is bent. the casino is nothing but legal theft. and that's ok. it's the system. half the punters who come in are using stolen money, drug money, they haven't earned it. we earn our money.  i'm on your side, jack. i don't need an enemy.
sure, why not.
yeah, plenty.  some of them can't walk!
see! you don't understand!
he's a little spoiled, but i know he does.
i know but let's hear it anyway.
nah. they don't care about some faggot hustler. they're more interested in your daughter's health -- and yours. like i am.
too much. eighteen hundred.
is that a threat?
is he your boyfriend?
we put it in a nice neat pile and file it away, on the slim chance it's ever needed in a courtroom.  it's like collecting diamonds on a desert island.  you keep them just in case you ever get rescued, but it's a pretty big ocean out there.
sue was trying to get hold of you.
no. you won't be able to do it. he will rise. he will rise and you... you will die.

i don't know anything about it.
well i can't say that walter!  she's incomparable.  they're both great.

let's retrofit the dish to another satellite.
friend of mine, owns a club.  dickie randall.  you'd know him if you saw him.  his brother was in your class. terry.
you gotta be kidding me.  the new guys'll be short-stroking it over this one.  a one-day pattern killer.
no. no...we need to try our vaccine on it.
huh. maybe he figured the news our london bureau got a visit from a hitman on behalf of a pissed off client wouldn’t go down too well. he only shared his guilty secret last night. and then only ‘cause he was so fucking edgy after calling his hotel we persuaded him to talk.
pour that back.
when you were taken prisoner at compiegne, did you have a horse?
--it's urgent!
this is not giving blood. this is drunk.

this doesn't make any sense; you are going to drag that poor boy out in the cold air.
truman used it all the time.
thank you. excuse me.
you're an idiot.
thirty-five.
oh, no, never... nothing like that... never crossed my mind.
yes.
as usual, i don't have anything to do.
is there some kind of trick answer?
perhaps it's because she has amnesia too - can't remember. . .
i wanna take it anyway.  just in case.
i’m well aware of your stake in this, 007. if you have a point, get to it.

he was convicted in a court of law. your testimony put him away. it doesn't matter what i think.

frank.  i'm here.  i always get here.  don't sweat it.
why?
oh please, ford, i'll do any --
no need to be modest, brian.
what's he talking about?
magruder does.
i just pulled a shark tooth the size of a shot glass out of the hull of a wrecked boat out there.
listen, it isn't so terribly important. we can go to the theatre any time.
you never get over it.
i’m out of the doghouse?
he's blessing the house.
i'm fine.  come on, we have to keep moving.
yes. well, i guess we can walk from here.
marcie - calm down. calm down and don't do this. i want you to stay --
yes.
oh, i cannot leave her now when she needs me the most.

lieutenant.

we catch 'em, i wanna be first to hurt 'em.  promise me i get to go first.
that's right.
do you know how long all this will last? not thirty years... or thirty thousand years... but thirty thousand years... and you'll be part of it. ages will roll... ages. and you'll be here... the two of you... eternally frozen... frozen... beautiful.
don't talk like that.  i'm sure there must be some girl some place that could -
what's a metrix?
read the inscription on the cover!
karl!!
bene.
it's full a money.
no.  you know that i'm not.
that's funny, we've got five thousand horses but no men.
look.  listen.  listen.  you want to write?  write.
my cousin? my aunt found him. on his bed, doubled over himself with his legs on top. dick in his mouth. my aunt freaked out. it was a mess.
you needn't be embarrassed, madame. a lady as charming as you would, and <u>should</u>, get love letters.
i'm separating the ladies from the gentlemen....
eh... mr. grady... weren't you once the caretaker here?
i don't know.
i... i... went to this bar... this very, ya know -- hard-to-get-in place... called babbitt's...
some cash. jewelry. the other stuff i can replace, but there's a cardboard box... photos of my mother. they're the only ones i have of her.

that one.
jim please --
uh-huh.

i'm your son.
dickie?
who is she? where she come from?
that's good.  that's right!  they died around a dried-up puddle!  without fighting each other.  this is looking good.
lydia, we're the first trickle! in a couple of years this whole town will be <u>filled</u> with people like us.
yes.
i know how he found me.
who didn't?
i would say so.
look, it's okay for me to shit the street. but you gotta use a toilet.
you got wax in your ears?
it's a great shirt. don't worry about it.
yeah.
look at me -- i'm not even listening to a word you're saying.
huh.
you can ask.
how can i do anything if i'm being watched every second?
not all.  radio is out.  but our field phones are okay so far.
that's a laugh.  if i don't ask, at least i won't be disobeying him.
'bout time, pop.
maybe the thought of people like you going on holiday bothers me. come on, let’s go...
dead you're worthless, darling.
you got no idea...
this happens....this is something that happens.
look, it's my duty as a knight to try and sample as much peril as i can.
it's not possible right now.
tst-tst! then i reckon i'll have to try again! where's the money hid?
what are you tired from?
i'd use the word insane.
you don't understand. it's an addiction. you fight night after night, trying to fill the emptiness. but the pain's back in the morning. and somewhere along the way it stops being a choice.  i want better for you.
what about?
i'd love one.  whatever you're having.
well, i'm getting tired of it. i need your attention.
motherfucker, we're handing you money. what the hell we gonna pull?
do you still want the operation?
siesta.
the mets.  john doesn't think they've got a deep enough pitching roster this year, and i'm inclined to agree.
we're not gonna let it.
i heard you. but i'm choosing to ignore you. epps, let's go.
a tooth they say couldn't have come from any bear.  they say it looks prehistoric.  like maybe a dinosaur.
 i'm bloody dressing as fast as i can, for god's sake!
come on, spicoli. why don't you just put your shirts back on? see the sign?
he's a pain in the ass.
-- your intel corroborates what we already know. sparazza's health is in rapid decline and before his date with destiny, it seems he wants one last thing... the heart of his sworn enemy. a recently opened, cash rich escrow account has been traced back to sparazza. this and the mention of this mysterious swede makes the million dollar contract on israel very real.
i'd just like to pick up a few of my things
is there something more we should know about this suspect, sir?  i mean besides what's on his sheet.
not yet, but...  hey, there's only a grand here.
you were with gruner!
walls of shining crystals, burning with red fire, furnishings of metals and jewels never seen by man...
i guess...
i think so.
sir ?
name it.
you rigged it...you spent all that money on an education and you come back looking like this....
rudolf?  c'mere, rudolf!
alright, johnson, thank you.  so...what are you wearing?
peter -- if you can get him to do that for me he'd obviously do the same for you -- we could -- !
well, i thought that... well, the way it always works is that sga president does a count, then the sga advisor, you know, for the two independent counts.
it's...gone...!
there was a lawyer. kobayashi.
we wait. i need about fifteen. call me if there are any changes. if she farts i want a full report.
huh?
we all got a secret side, baby. hope you don't think i been lyin' to you 'bout other things, sugar.
where do you think, my idiot friend? we're in a nice filthy cemetery. does this make you happy? is this fitting and proper enough?
i know.  i'm sorry.  i'll make a fire. i'll be back.
i think if everyone were honest, they'd confess that the lady looks exactly like a man in drag.
drake hotel, penthouse suite.  never stop worrying.  i figure we'll do a sidebar on what it's like to go from sleeping in your car and collecting cans to sleeping in the poshest suite in town.  also gale's onto something, digging into his background.
they used to believe that sort of thing in the mountain villages. some still do --
make a wish, lo.
i'm the captain of this majestic ship.  it goes where i take it....
where do you want to go?
go fuck yourself.
my father's never done a thing for any of them.
i put her in the guest room, just down the hall.
i want to work today, that's why i came...
i didn't know we had any women left.
i did.  i did, reed...but i wanted <u>you</u> to be that man.
never.
i bet that's exactly what she tells herself! but you and i both know she's just a dried-up bitter old maid. say, how about you and i grab a little dinner and a show after work? i was thinking maybe the king and i --
you're a guest here?
nothing, i guess. i guess i can wait till we get home. maybe we'll stop by wickham's for a hamburger when we get to lawford. that suit you? you always like wickham's.
what fuckin grocery store, you fucking shithead idiot! you call yourself a police...
i left my wallet. my credit cards, cash, fucking id, everything. we gotta go back.
no.  i'm okay.
castor troy almost strangled me to death.  where the hell were you?
wrong preposition...
onscreen.
an injun will chase a thing til he thinks he's chased it enough...then he quits...same when he runs...seems he never learns there's such a thing as a critter that might just keep comin' on...so we'll find them in the end, i promise you that...we'll find them just as sure as the turning of the earth.
i don't work for them, either.
artsy little village down seven.  there's a guy there who sells my work.  i had just dropped off some paintings and as i got in my car...i saw norman sitting at this little cafe.

travis, you haven't even played the record?
you see?
thank him and tell him we're sorry about his loss.
vanessa has wanted a baby since we got married.
goodnight.
that's odd. uhura, what's on the comm channels...?
pinching me!
lock the door.
you see, my wife -- i mean, your wife -- that is, i mean hildy -- had led me to expect that she was marrying a much older man.
it's a gig.

when i'm surrounded, with my back against the wall, you're not going to lay down on me, are you --
no, we're all right. thanks anyway, tommy.
i'm sorry.
the fans of narcissus.  they were on vigil outside the school of proximo. they believe he's dying.
it's a farce.
yeah, maybe it'll be okay. at least i'll get to see every movie for free, i guess... i had to lie and tell them i already graduated...
ya, ya goin' outta the bedroom an' i don't wanna know from nothin'.
what about you?!
uh-huh.
i think the phrase was &quot;sleazoid geek&quot;.
it was a war party. it means they're on the attack up and down the frontier.
will you come soon?
you are too crude.
but they have to be diplomatic.
we can always come back together again. because there's no-there's no problem. 'cause... right.
what is it with you litterbugs?  is it a territorial thing, marking your turf with your garbage?
everybody has a great body now.
mr. bialystock ...
no -- no -- no -- no...
it’s a snuff movie. prime paedophile material. i’m told it retails at around £4,000.  i see you don’t require a definition.

so, what are we waiting for?
we'll see, schwartz. we'll see.
pearl-handled .25 automatic, uh?  no, it's a belgian gun... 6.6 mm.
anything like work aroun' here?
you told him you liked him.
take it easy.
you see how much we have to say.
why do you say things like that?  you're so much better than you know.
it's already built!  there's a basement substructure where they used to keep weapons and stuff, but beneath that there's these old catacombs that the christians built 'bout a thousand fucking years ago to bury their dead.  we're sitting right on top of it -- here.
is that good?

some note shawnee easton told me to give to you.

-- unless frank is specifically ommitted as a beneficiary that's what will happen.
i speak english.
yeah.  that's it.
the future guy?
what makes you say that?
a reaction to azt...
take your average cop.  they deal with death everyday.  if they let emotions get in the way it would cloud their judgement.
poolside?
how did they threaten you?
we oughta stay somewhere outta the way. not in no holidays or ramadas or motel six. if johnnie farragut's on our trail he'll check those first.
yes... but the enterprise... my duty...
hail, mary.
i know...
i'll bet.
well, he was always a little crazy... he puts a gun in his mouth...  ...like your friend...comme si chiama...henning?  heming?
i said we'll talk later, roy.  if you're what i think you are you should know when to listen, when to shut up... and when to pray.
they got a steady stream of supply. so, no...
no sir, i haven't forgotten.
i got him.  i got the son-of-a-bitch. see, i was doing really good up till then. lots of street busts.  i've always had this weird luck... everything always went my way, but this was wild.  i got him with one shot... right between the eyes.  next thing i know, the mayor's pinning a medal on me.  picture in the paper, whole nine yards.
which clinic?
i don't understand.
sure. why not?
we have decided to move the government to gitarama.
yes, it's the big potato. just have a look at this.
you'll answer my questions?
cahuenga pass. make your way up through the mountains toward the hollywood bowl. you should be able to pick up utopia's tracer there.  once you go inside, you're on your own.  you know what you have to do with the girl, don't you?  we have to spare this nation her trial - for treason.
well we gotta do something!
we'd go to his car.
...and she's with someone else.
mr. smith, i've read some of your plays and i'd like an autograph.
but you don't?
and you met mary how?
i will be with thee straight.
jason?! where is he?!
yes.
something's on.
you're welcome.  dad?…would you let me try hypnotizing you now?
you talk as if he were a gigolo—or something.
so there you are. what do you say?
conglomerates're lined up to finance the launch of the remaining satellites. they'll pay him a huge premium to get on-line.
they know what you want, believe me. pretending is just a waste of time. you're gonna take them there eventually anyway. don't apologize for it.
i don't give a shit, qualen!  i had to be insane to ever tie up with a low-life, piece of shit like you.  they beat us.  a couple of fuckin' hick mountain boys beat the man no law agency ever could.
bit, scratched.  but i had her pinned. she calmed down.  i was going to cuff her... she said she thought she was going to be sick.  she asked to use the bathroom.
are you drunk, mulder?
i didn't hear nothin' till last night.
you too.
is this leading somewhere?
maybe it's harder for them to say it than they let on. at the very least, they believe it's in our best interest. and at the end of the day, they may end up being right.
yeah, but they're all little wannabes. i'm looking for a professional man.
agnes, did you love your mother?
yes i did.  i said mmmmmm!
no.
yeah, they're good. they're good, tommy.
don't worry. i will draw his fire.  with a few of my own.
michael, take deep breaths.
what was it about her that disturbed you so, billy?
bobby? are you all right?
well, give it to me then.
i betrayed a man.  a good man.  an innocent man.  a thief.
yes.
you know nothing.  what you don't know would fill a book.  jesus, i feel like it's when you're around i need it most.  you're never yourself, you never relax.  never. everything's so stiff and dead. you always have to keep a rein on everything, ever yourself.  oh, you smile sometimes, i've even seen you laugh.  but there's no light in your smile for me, wyatt, nothing to keep me warm. and i get cold, wyatt.  i get so cold.  what's between you and that jew woman?
well why don't you take your pants off and stroke it for me?
who is he?
you shit! i'll decide if i go or not. not you. i don't know what you do on your planet, but i didn't think that was very nice walking out on me like you did.
you don't think i've tried? no one is willing to open the picture
nobody.
we're going to keep driving.
i got a new deal for you.
how are you going to pay when you get sick?
virgil!  now look at what you done!  are you all right?
still no word from star command. we're not that far from the spaceport --
unbelievable.
no.
oh yeah, murder museum... sounds fun.
sorry.
cause i'll go right over there and bring her here.
well, it still sucks, but you start to see that there are advantages to being single.
don't worry, duffy, you'll have it back by five.  thanks, duffy. stick around. 
what's tira misu?
i don't know why i'm doing this. i half wish you'd stay a cripple.
you go, boy.
you just called me ivy.  who's ivy?
check him out.
god, that's so pathetic. i bet she didn't even notice him.
i'm just looking at you. does that make you uncomfortable?
oh, yeah?
why?
now that's cool.
am i really gonna have my own room?
no--i--i'll take a walk-- 
nothin' really. just kinda goin' back and forth. they had some black girl from some black show on jay leno. i watched that for a bit, but i kept flippin channels cause i didn't know who she was.
yeah, i'm gonna have to go to l.a.
right.
all over.  did you see your new apartment?
just give me a chip of ice to put in my mouth. just a chip of ice.
both, see you later.
have you forgotten who saved your life in geneva?
sorry to hear it.
tom grunemann. he wrote you some letters.
-- she's a very compulsive girl.
he is just being like all parents, concerned about the ones they love.
it's a place where religious people--
only if i want something bad enough.
i'm sure that didn't upset her. everyone in our family takes showers.
you certainly traded up.  ...the trophy wife.  nice lookin'.
--anna--
i feel like i'm entering a forbidden tomb...
i know you did.
this ain't your lot?
what are you talking about?  what do you think i'm doin'?  i'm gettin' the ball rollin'.  i'm keeping these people happy ... i'm keeping you happy ... i gotta keep the cops cooled out ... i gotta do everything ... i gotta pay for the pizza ... i'm workin' on it, do you know what i mean?  i'm workin' on it ... jesus christ!  i gotta do it all ... i got all the ideas ... you want me to give you the gun?  you want to take it over?
i feel the force.
you got two minor league home run records don't you?
it isn't a story - it's true.  i did see wynant.  he's not dead.
wanted to wish you luck.  not that you'll need it.
you ask them.
there was a man named colonel wilson, from the air force base.  he was talking in our class.  he said we could visit him any time we wanted.  i'll bet he could do something.
where did you get this?
if he had no idea, why did the jews need saving? this is the question, emmi, to all germans: why did the jews need saving in this country? why, if people had no idea?
... he ought to put him in here.
ah, that's a dark and unpleasant tale, best left untold.
yes, adulation is a cross to bear. god knows <u>i</u> know.  but someone's got to supplant our standing-in- the-way-of-progress mayor and don't deny it, mr. cobblepot, you've got the magic!
thanks.
i am harold ryan, her husband.  i have killed perhaps two hundred men in wars of various sorts--as a professional soldier.  i have killed thousands of other animals as well--for sport.
freylag's stronghold?
i've been better --
i'm so hungry.
oh, you know, the usual.  bowl. drive around.  the occasional acid flashback.
that shirt?
no, don't!
about what!
i don't go at all.
my father doesn't answer. i have to go find him.
what?
carolyn showed me where she hid him, hid him with all the ones he killed --
here, check these out.
who? how would i know him?
and this has what to do with me?
the financial kind. i figure i'm going to be working extra hours. all sorts of overtime... training sessions... not to mention the extra stress...
when peter was little, he loved to hide.  in closets, under the sink. he needed a secret place.  but when i'd look for him, he'd laugh... he wanted to be found.
then let's call it a business proposition. something to round out your salary.
and the money. where do we bring the money?
that's logical. and if you don't sleep, you don't need a bed. saves you money, too.  so what's this story you're working on, anyway?
is everything okay?
nope.
yes...james, it is knowing that these beautiful women arouse you that arouses me...
--we didn't want--<i>diseases</i>, yes.
it doesn't hurt.  why doesn't it hurt?
"-- an axe!"
a bit fucking late.
yeah... that's all it is.
who?
how long do you plan to live in new york, mrs. kramer?
the pay's the same but you'll make more in tips.
no!!  it's a wonder you couldn't get me something i can eat.
look at him. he doesn't understand english. he moves like an animal.
for your eyes. for most patients of your age, i generally administer retlax five to restore flexibility of the lens.
a little place in los olivos. new owners. cozy ambiance. excellent food too -- you should try it. thought of you at the hitching post last night.
you're getting defensive, will.
nine?
as you prefer, squire.  as you prefer.
we have to keep the hopes of these men alive!
go.
and it is forbidden for you to interfere with human history. all you can do, kal-el, even now that you have...found yourself...is help them to evolve. set an example. show them they must strive towards the light. and... remember us...
erin. i know you think she's been talking to you.
which one?

you think i can lose?
shut up! this is a professional relationship!
first time for everything.
who's the old geezer?
and do you think they like the fact that half the country thinks crystal lake is filled with corpses?
this is science-fiction robert! the manager showed me the transfer notice with your signature on it.
no. i just wake up and i look around, try to figure out where i am... how i got there.
uoy era ohw.
i just love her.  how're you doing?
we're not supposed to get drunk. we're on call.
what do you want?
yes, but why?
i'm all right.
god damn it, why does she keep saying that?
yeah, stick around, you might learn something.
i'll go with him --
fucked up.  that's what they said i was.

you kidding? i don't wanna leave all this, i just wanna leave marty...
his name is frank.
sounds reasonable.
look, i'd love to keep chatting-
alight, alright.  stay calm.  you opened this door.  there's got to be a way that you can close it.
so what's going on?  who's lou again?
wait, i've made up my mind. i want a plain omelette, forget the tomatoes, don't put potatoes on the plate, and give me a side of wheat toast and a cup of coffee.
why? people fart backwards.
tomorrow.
i'm not, you know.
no.
six meters.  five.  what the fu --
huh. and why is that?
when you get up you put on a negligee, and then you change to a morning frock.
when jack sees they've got rachel he'll tell them what they want to know.
did i tell you we've expanded the search spectrum?  we're including several other possible magic frequencies -- not just the hydrogen line anymore.  i was trying to get inside their heads, y'know?  and i started thinking, what other constants are there in the universe besides hydrogen, and then suddenly it was so obvious -- transcendantals, right?  so we've been trying variations of pi...
why don't you open it and find out?
that's right.
deflector dish... why the deflector dish...?
dave, these things get awfully complicated sometimes...
what's her name?

many of them, many did not possess proper arms.  my lord.
you have the power to do it.  i want you to do it.  please.
i know you will, bruce. are you going to live with your mother?
you almost knocked me down.  the word is "excuse me."
you tell me. i don't know how you managed to hack into my mac, but: bravo.
if i wasn't a righteous black man you'd be in serious trouble. serious.
no, wait...
any id on the shooter yet?
oh, stop talking about yourself like you're a lush or something. i don't like it.  maybe you ought to go to a clinic, get some treatments.
just waiting for you, tubs.
how do you mean?
sure, but cameron asked me too.  anybody mind including him?
you didn't tell him about me?
i like fire.
you don't act like the rest of gideon's friends. they believe if you are not hard at work, you are hard at sin.

after we've looked, we'll talk.
who tells you these things?
not at all.
the gate has but one key, and i carry that.
you see, all we need to do is get a better shot at it with weapons that don't rely on heat seeking...
it's daniel.
hey, wait a minute. you got change comin'.
fear is their greatest weapon.
i've got my dr. gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...
boyfriend?
right. i recognized you when i came in. i thought you might like to know what it felt like to be on the other end of a gag. what do you think of that, miss daniels?
they got the guys on a <u>retainer</u>, it's cheaper, <u>pay</u>'em, but don't lettem touch it... let'em leave us alone.
mother?
do you miss him?
in my personal observation, i think that more people are neat than are clean...
the lingerie.
we're being asked to cooperate in a matter of national security.  now you know exactly as much as i do.  so just get your gear off and get up to control.  there's some kind of briefing in ten minutes.
it's the only way.
dad!
mom, just give me five more minutes. just five minutes, okay?
did you stop to talk to anyone, judy?  do you enjoy that?
it's a complicated case, maude. lotta ins, lotta outs.  fortunately i've been adhering to a pretty strict, uh, drug regimen to keep my mind, you know, limber.  i'm real fucking close to your father's money, real fucking close.  it's just--
i can't go out.
excuse me, i just want to --
it's visualization therapy.  he's helping me turn inward and fight the disease.
louise, let me call you back after i wire it, so you'll know which office to go to.
and... where are things?
i know that the great blessing has kept the peace for a thousand years, and will keep it for the next thousand.
who'd you get?
i think i should.  3000w?
what exactly?
federation support, federation procedures, federation rules... look in the mirror, admiral... the federation is old... in the last twenty four months, it's been challenged by every major power in the quadrant -- the borg, the cardassians, the dominion... they all smell the scent of death on the federation. that's why you've embraced our offer... because it will give your dear federation new life. well, how badly do you want it, admiral? because there are hard choices to be made now. if the enterprise gets through with news about their brave captain's valiant struggle on behalf of the defenseless ba'ku, your federation politicians will waver, your federation opinion polls will open a public debate, your federation allies will want their say... need i go on?
eight -- and seven months.
and - one morning i just - ran away...
of course i'm proud.  you know he started with nothing?  look at him today.  playing concerts.
i understand something.
sure.
get with what?
that's not my fault.
did he say who?
well, sir, if you should do it again, which i hope you won't, please remember the order. counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet.
of course i do.
yes.
do you find him attractive?
dolores, i got five days to shoot this movie.  quit kidding around.
i'm sorry!  i said something wrong, didn't i!  please forgive me!
hey, dad, i'm almost finished laying down my monsters of metal compilation tape. i really think it's a masterpiece.
dr. lester, would you point me toward the restroom?
what?
no, you don't!
really?
spock. does the good of the many outweigh the good of the one...?
i can't stand it.  oh god, i can't stand it!
lemme feed you, sweetie, while they hot.
october 12, 1969.
the sound again?
<i>remove... ... the... right arm.</i>
i don't know... what are you looking up?
i didn't know i'd ever need it again.
sure it is, sweet pea, but he should've warned you 'scuzzy' female types about the 'puget dudes.' they'll tell you they're wearing a rubber but they've bit a little hole in the end.
because it pays off.
you're a drunk fool.
stay out of my face or i'll go straight to max.
who?
stands on the edge of the woods, almost in a trance.
you didn't want us calling anybody. too liable to ruin your big payday.
no.
right. six hundred years before the crusades.
aren't you going to change?
hudson, i'm afraid i'm sticking with god.  but you're a close second, tough guy.  what is that smile?
city of la habra heights filled an 800,000 gallon reservoir with sixteen inches of rain in two days.
yes.
it's fine. comfortable. i still can't get used to how dark it gets around here, though. when we leave the ranch, i always hold my breath until i can see the motel.
but...
never had to.
i know that.
it's been changed.
that's all right.  see you on thursday.
what if i've figured a way?
it's brighter there... besides, we can't go back.
come on.  at least no one's gonna see how bad you are.
should be over there.
about jack? no. have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately?
oh, i'm so sorry...
persia.  it belonged to a king.
but you didn't hurt anybody.
in japan, men come first and women come second.
you sure this is okay?
shut up.  you have bread, don't you, and a toaster of some kind?
i get the robe an' paulie gets three grand.
who's they?
it is when you love someone, and they don't love you. and then you do something about it.
j'ai pas confiance en lui.
which one?
she seems confused, irresponsible, overemotional. my wife says that's the way girls act sometimes.
yeah.
time, i've got plenty of.
who?  hello, butch! where are you?
how's the book?
he's not the murderer.  but he's a bozo.
i know a way.
making a male climax is not all that challenging: insert somewhere close and preferably moist; thrust; repeat.
but she must know... unless... unless... rose, was there more than one person?
we have to keep moving.
no, you don't owe me anything.
don't worry, i can get rid of this. no trace. and i'll even go fifty fifty, we're partners aren't we?
hi, adele.
you have to remember, we-we-we didn't agree on one thing.
any trouble, we whip out our treasury department badges -- show them the wire i'm wearing and read them their rights.  theo seizes the krugerands as evidence. naturally they start negotiating. offer to give us up somebody else. and we listen.  take notes on who bought what stolen art and tell them we have to clear it with our superiors at justice.  we pick up their passports -- escort them to their room and leave them all in the bathroom handcuffed to the plumbing.
look special agent moonan... we don't know what you're talking about.
good example! good example of what i'd like to know? he didn't even kill nobody... he couldn't do it no more.
you don't have a boyfriend?
yes.
who?  who's doing this to you?
is there a script?
remember what foley said? his little warning? those are the girls he was talking about. they're out to marry us any way they can.
just in case they don't give you your visa to russia i want you to know that i have signed a contract for my memoirs and rented a lovely little château in the touraine, and if you feel the need of a change...
stunt?
jean-i'm not-
i guess so.
yes.
shhh.
bull fiddle.
did you ever daydream that you would one day meet a friendly millionaire?
... is that i sent them here. i told them she came here sometimes. with her dirtball boyfriend. that's exactly what i said.
i know.  is *that* nothing.
just who the fuck do you think you are?!  get out!  you're fired!
yeah, once i cut them off.  why?
what exactly did you hear?
yeah.
i thought i'd be spontaneous.  i mean, that's the point of this whole thing, isn't it?
"abraham, martin, and john." that's a nice one.
no one would ever have to know its not him.
i'll see you tomorrow.
do i have a lot of brothers and sisters?
bingo!
in this drawer....
all right, they do.
no, i don't...no.  i thought we were just friends.
their what...?
i wouldn't know, dude.  i deal in publishing, entertainment, political advocacy, and--
buddha teaches that we must learn from our enemy. we have compassion for all people.
thanks, steve.
i can't believe i lost an eye for a bunch of phony c.d.s
where are they holding the wake? i'm supposed to be one of the pallbearers.
catherine...
it doesn't make sense.  who would want to do that to you?
i know.
brindisi versus electric boat.
try twenty-five.
well, look, i don't claim to be an expert--
did you pass out again, grady? did you fall somewhere?
do you have this agreement with you?
you see? life can be so simple.
honey it's to help you.
bastards! stop!
where did you get these? who are you?
twenty! what did he do with them?
... then proceed downriver to extraction at point echo delta. doyle takes us out by helicopter, we all live happily ever after and that's the last time, rambo!  i swear to christ.
did you see it?
it's quite out of the question.
absolutely.
i remember.
that's a crappy thing to say.
we can go to one if you'd prefer.
you think it will?
i knew she had it.
who's mr. lindgren?
in jail.
i am...i am...it's just that i know martha'd want you to think of her boys as well as her girls...and if the girls are...dead...ethan, don't let the boys waste their lives in vengeance!
hello, i think... i could be mistaken. they're using a very primitive dialect.  but i do believe they think i am some sort of god.
no, you're dead! you're all dead!
the voice was in your cell?
no, man, that's fine. just put that you took delivery.
buff, please, would you jus fuck off, okay? fuck off!
you're joking --
if you'd had the sense to ask for my help, i might've helped you. but you've probably scared chuckie roeder off for good, i have a whole bunch of jumpy employees to handle and you're both going to be on your way. now.
i don't want to leave her.  dick ...the, the ... and father laughlin, he said that it was god's will ...
where the fuck is foley?
i just gotta talk to her, t.j.
we just did.
amen.
but you need a man right now. it wouldn't be fair to you to --
what?!
yeah, i don't know how you could make that confusion.
we offer...
that's me.
you have to shave? like an ape?
i don't know. i don't know what happened mother, i woke up... there was blood on the sheets, but i don't know what happened.  i don't know what i did wrong, i don't know and i should be punished.
well, just common sense, sir.  thirty from thirty-four equals four, or my name's not "buck" schmuck!
oh, yeah, of course, dear.
by pulling my hair?!
not to speak of. peter and i were both loners. there was nobody.
a new pediatric wing at the hospital? a presidential campaign? name it. anything.
stephanie.
sir, we can't just let him get away with this!
it's so beautiful!
i'm getting so good at this.
abbott wants to talk.
me?
what's it say?
that's good. i like to watch, too.
that was exciting!
i... think we need to talk, there's something really strange going on...
well...it's kind of a sociological study in the aftermath of columbine.
go to bed then.  miss has grown up, and is getting married soon.  god knows what the future will bring.
i didn't think i could sleep. i'm surprised you could. are you all right?
maybe you need to start.
i want you to take her with you.
russian women prisoners?
okay.
okay... okay...  i put it down.  now open that door. mister fisher's right on the other side of that door.  he's an actor...

washington is full of cornpone country pussy -- just ask jesse jackson.
i brought you something.

in the car.
okay.  you're a czech national and you're a russian national.  how do you know one another?
you've been cheating on me haven't you?
you didn't even hafta say it. i know the woman.
even if it's the difference between some trooper recognizing us and throwing us in prison or not?
i didn't think i was being defensive. i was just...
in the winnebago.
i'm not the first lady, anymore.  i shouldn't be here.
no i quit.
i'll go then.
it must really be somehtin' --makin' stuff up all the time.
we have already captured a dozen incendiaries, convicts, released just two days ago.  they said they were acting under orders of the secret police.

it's the truth.  why won't you believe it?
let's see if i can bring it back to life.
you are one lucky sonofabitch, you know that?
edna! come dance with me! let's be foolish tonight.
we took the liberty of calling your dentist -- we thought, perhaps, we would learn something.
i had him in my grasp.
rotten luck, this storm.  get my grandchildren on the radio will you?  i don't want them to worry about a wee bit of rain.
i like having the car, the car is important.
i'm sure we could find a date for your team. why don't i take it up with henry?  thanks for the drink, boys.
say... "equus"? it's got everything.
tavis, thank you for having me.
she starts givin' me some bullshit about it ain't there. it's somewhere else and we can go get it.  i'm shootin' you in the head right then and there. then i'm gonna shoot her in the kneecap, find out where my godamn money is. i go walkin' in there and that nigga winston or anybody else is in there, you're the first man shot, understand what i'm sayin'?
hey, what i did for you is working out?
has mr. kessler said anything regarding the attack on the moors?
aim what?
captain, we're receiving transmission from paradise city. they're demanding to know our intentions.
lions and tigers and bears!
terry valentine.
they got a sign on him in front of greely's?
carbon units have clearly retarded enterprise's proper evolvement.
yes.
rio. flight 306. departs at eleven pm.
oh yes, yes. one day a beautiful car comes here. this beautiful lady in furs gets out. there is a handsome man with her, and the chauffeur  the lady rents one of our upstairs rooms. the chauffeur changes the lock on the door. then the lady never comes back --not to live, anyhow. she came back three, four times, but always alone and just to eat.
it's the fire alarm. somebody pulled the fire alarm.
alright, everyone.  you're clear to come up.
charlie, couple of courses isn't enough to get you student deferred... i mean if they wanted to draft you, you would've been drafted by now.
but you did, and have... and now people are dead.  did sparazza become more valuable than israel... and did you make another deal?
right, mike.
watch me, grandma....
anne, they're my moods. if you want to understand moods, have one of your own!
do me a favor.  don't pretend for a second that you and i don't know the truth.  you can convince time magazine and the skeptical inquirer of whatever you want, but i was there.
dewey, there's no such place.
oh i love to cook. i guess most women wouldn't invite a man over on the first date, but i believe you should trust your instincts. when i talked to you on the phone you just seemed so... i don't know... harmless. ready for ice cream?
then the thighs where they joined the torso.
can i quote you?
it was alright for a while, you know.  but then she got promoted to project engineer on this thing, couple years ago.
you're not gross.  why were you wearing a sheet?
how the hell do i know about brown & williamson?
what happened?
here we go.
i'm talking about some bad, bad, very bad things. bad things! those are bad fucking things!
i don't believe it, jean – they're picking straws.
well, there's a lot of boring stuff to do. lists of people we have to write to. find mama's relatives addresses in italy -- stuff like that.
okay. yeah.
i don't understand.
you may be right.
it's taken care of. the less you know about it the better.
so we cut her loose and wait it out. a little weather couldn't be anything she hasn't seen before.
but aren't you tired? i can just about manage to stand on my feet!  raimondo!
i am not so well-born.
ain't over yet.  night is part of day; separate, but equal.  night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.
coming.
jerry!  you can't be serious!
oh man, you shoulda come with us last night, marty. that one for you was a real lunatic. how'd you make out?
no, not yet.
i'm really sorry.
we don't exactly have the best bargaining position.
i'll be down in a jiffy.
regular storage procedure... the same as the other food... the other food stopped coming and they started.
i don't know if i want to stay here. i don't feel safe.
thank goodness. we'd be out of work.
ever pick your feet in poughkeepsie?
we took for granted his source of energy was nuclear.  but suppose it isn't at all - what if it's <u>magnetic</u>?
i know. i might need to be spanked.
why do i? -- i come in here -- instinctively -- first thing i do -- i'm looking for the exit -- i'm catching the sightlines -- i know i can't sit with my back to the door --
no, no, sugar - wait.  i have a feeling she's going to show up any minute.
please.  don't.
uh, no.
what's this about?
you're a beautiful girl, elle.
and thank you as well for that conversational hiatus; i generally refrain from speech while engaged in gustation. there are those who attempt both at the same time but i find it course and vulgar. now where were we?
it may well be. i know how you won that election selena. you can't fool me.
good.  good.  now, i hold in my hand a photostatic copy of the attendance roster for the "bread instead of bullets club" of the university of california, los angeles, dated october 11, 1935.  a copy of this paper is before you, mr. appleton. do you recognize it?
drugs can help suppress symptoms. but lots of patients stop taking them when they're on their own because the side effects are so harsh.  and, michael's condition is often worsened by periods of stress. he's been in and out of...
oh yeah.  they were working on molecular assemblers, too, weren't they?
that's the dumbest walk i ever saw!
okay, good.  i think i should be the one to tell 'em, cause they trust me more than --
trychticholorate? alright, it's an absorption catalyst in toxic waste accidents. it's pretty rare, they stopped making it a couple'a years ago.
you must be joking. i never eat breakfast,  did you sleep well?
who are you?
is that why you come in here tossing pennies to my starving men? it's damned condescending!
i'm listening, joanna--believe me, i'm listening.  my wife is walking out on me after eight years of--
how long have you had it?
ah, the old and doddering.  i'm going to scourge their puny minds, reducing them to zombie's. and then i'll put them to work rebuilding my empire.
right!  where?
could anyone have gotten it from you?
more this way.
no.
we're all going to have to go out for breakfast.  the cook quit yesterday.
he was, like, a total babe
roast tom turkey. gee, i'm hungry too --
i'm afraid she's not in.
then we smash 'em?
sure, earl, everybody knows about them.  we just didn't tell <u>you</u>. come on, nobody's ever seen one of these!  we're really <u>in</u> on something here!
i am not a child.
oh, oh, yes.  i-i-i-'d like to, uh, uh, very much.
look at that.  get a gander.
you are young. you don't understand the attraction of great power, and you forget the pain of long waiting.
i am so upset, monsieur rick. you know i can't understand --
that's life.  my kisses are alive.
it's a carlton fisk baseball card.
but, father, i don't really want any of that.
no, but i hear it's terrible. then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child, fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine.
but it's true. take 'em up in your hands, mary -- feel 'em -- they're real all right.  aren't you glad?
you know it is.
i do so love you.  what do you smell of?
how do you do that?
and he told you then his father was a famous virologist.
what?
have you got the will?
<u>what</u>?
yeah, what?
it's okay, baby, the police are coming.
did you know he's already got a bad knee? in another 10 years you're going to be pushing him around in a wheelchair.
how are you doing?
well, i'm there. i hide in the back as much as is humanly possible. you have a cell phone? i need to quit right this minute. i'll call in dead.
remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
no!
i don't know.
what are you talking about?
i think it's about that time, letty. the charges against you have been dropped, the drugs have evened out and you seem to be dealing with your life quite well.
nu mung ba. last i heard, walter kurtz commanded a green beret detachment at nu mung ba.
and the child...
i never played tennis. you just travel around bobby-- no direction, no steady work.  you must like taking chances.
so i've heard--
not know.
derek mantini!
you know how he is.  he goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs -- then he's satisfied.  it blows over.
no.
then... you're in a state of conflict, jeff.

i was tired and didn't have any place to go.
no english lord would trust an irishman!
why yes. it's my eightieth birthday.

sorry... i was distracted.
i didn't mean to liz. i'm sorry.
ah... he was hurt bad.  bullet nicked an artery... i don't know... an hour... hour and a half...

exploring. in the woods. many years ago. -- i was a solitary child.
you don't know for sure.  what about roy?  nobody's seen him.
what the hell, they can't fire both of us -- someone's got to be in charge, right?  which way are we going?
let us.  unless you object, i would like to deem this meeting a formal negotiation and, as such, there are certain customary practices. perhaps i could explain them to you...
-- the inside?
oh.
keep doing it! this is the whole works, joe--we're out of business of bigger than we then we ever were. we can't miss a trick--we can't stop at *anything*--till this yokel's smashed up and buried so deep he'll never--!
mind your own business, father.
let's settle with andy and put this whole tragic mess behind us.
we're going to turn ourselves in. it was self defense.
i don't *have* any time. there's a *war*!
you're too late.
no, she won't.
guys, guys, i'm sorry but, no way.

i suppose we might catch them off their guard.
listen to me.  i'm a good friend of jack foley.
oh, peter, i didn't dump you.  i just had to protect myself.  you really weren't very good for me, you know.
why yes, thank you.

shut-up!
go  that's the way we're going to go.  what do you say?
keep it.  go wild.  have a party.
okay, just hear me out.  what if carlo had been paid to help get sonny killed?  what if his beating of connie that time was a deliberate plot to get sonny out into the open? then what?  and what if the don, a great man, couldn't bring himself to do what he had to do, avenge his son's death by killing his daughter's husband?  what if that, finally, was too much for him, and he made michael his successor, knowing that michael would take that load off his shoulders, would take that guilt?
never, but i've been practicing.
killaine's not that sort of guy. he said no--he meant no.
we could try to run loads into these guys.  run a few loads for montoya into south florida.  into this group.

why'd you come to the house the other night?
i want your bar.
that also is a question of food, madame. i'll bring you a nice little lunch à la père mathieu. 
i really don't know, tom - he seems so honest and simple... in a way, he's quite charming...
i wanted for you to meet karl, too. he's my new friend. but i feel like i've always known him. i thought you should meet him.
i think i better take you home.
pain?  pain is just a state of mind. it's something you learn to live with. i have.
now, ma -- you just try to set an example for me, and keep hold of yourself.
always lookin' on the bright side, aren't ya?
i can't sleep nights.
i proved once and for all that the limb is mightier than the thumb.

it's a big part of the show.
she has it now.
that bitch.  what's keeping you from taking off?

anyway, we kent's don't like showoffs, ain't that so? a body's got to be humble even if he knows that he's better'n his neighbors.
he's a freak! that's how they live. we're partners, him and i, business partners. you're willfully deprivin' me of my livlihood!
i'll tell you what. when i get my engineering degree and i'm swimming in my swimming pool, it will be very fucking okay.
well, she never gave me none. look, you better find him a place pretty quick.
i guess i thought i was protecting you.
i think krueger's trying to do something to it.
oh.  i thought... you lead me --
he'll have to take a check.  i couldn't find my wallet.
how can i go on a feeling?  you think coffey's going to go on you 'feeling'?
we don't know nuthin' else.
and i'll never understand terrorists.
couldn't be.
i leave extras, miss.
would you like to go home if we can arrange it?  did you notify the parents?

it's okay.  look...  ...you gotta get a hold of yourself.
i ought to done it then--an' not come on any trip like this.
the bowery, you gotta deal with runoff from two bridges.

well, you are!
i'll get to it right away, mr. rawlston.
i don't know.  seems...
maybe.
not if you go.
i've got a new agenda now, it's get rich. the only way the iraqis figure into that is not at all.
that sounds like rizzo having faith in some of that future shit.
i'll be back.
call him up and ask - he might drop dead with shock.
i was not attempting to evaluate its moral implications, doctor. as a matter of cosmic history, it has always been easier to destroy than to create --
well, i'd like to - but i have a job to think of.
i came back for you; this morning i came back.  before i even knew about the money. you're what i want.
he's one of the great images of the twentieth century.  as important as the mona lisa.
i remember, sid! mr. kastle says he don't like no sticky fingers in the till.
no, honey... it was part of the deal.
they're alive, aren't they? come on, man! everyone's making such a fucking fuss, just because she's a nun. just because she wears a penguin suit, the church puts up 50 g for the guys who dared to rape her. do you think they'd put up a dime if you got raped? of course not. or even for your little sister? the virgin? like shit they would.
you will go to palace there.
oh yeah?
it's the jedi's time to eat, too.
he didn't veto it.  i ran the white house side.  the mob contact was johnny roselli.  one of the cia guys was that jackass, howard hunt.
why don't you come to a commune with me?
i wouldn't say that. but at least you've put the camera to good use.
ah, didier -- you are alive.
this is nothing.  it will blow over by tomorrow.
i'm used to being on the outside looking in.  the same men who will publicly profess their moral outrage for my sexual tastes are the same ones who privately rest their sweaty little hands on my legs and talk about weekend trips together.
well, it's not really my job to please. hope you learned something.
never mind how i found you.
so do you.
such a sordid state of affair.
then it's settled. what time is dinner, mother?
couldn't want a better death. lots of pretty girls, and we're going to use that new floor of yours tonight, too.

because you're pushing me to be something i'm not.

yeah, it's fine.
how do you know this...?

you couldn't have made that jump.

john, if you don't throw me the keys, then i'll just walk away. walk away and leave you here.
yes. did you lie about being on the american judo team in the olympics?
i found this at your brother’s.
i don't know.
i'm not sure.  i think i figured something out.  it must've been in my newsletter.
what do you mean, "what?"
and your mother -- everything's fine with her?
i don't think i can afford it. i don't want my dad paying.
my diagnosis is messed in the head. a poor little rich girl -- i mean check out the jeans and fur look. and lend your ears to this brutality. like her mom and step dad and her step-sisters are going to switzerland to ski over thanksgiving break -- and like they didn't invite her!

hey, i'm a man, aren't i? whattaya say we have dinner, then maybe head out to the beach, rub some of this tan off each other.  for old time's sake.
fifteen years ago?  it won't wash, pumpkin. no mother waits fifteen years to tell a man he's a father. i wasn't born yesterday, you know.
great, isn't it?

you know me...
that what you want?
no!
yeah.
i want to have the session. i thought it would be cool if i could show you some of the things that interest me. but i guess you're not into it... which we already knew.
founders of zion. builders of freeside.
but the paper ...
because i don't like you.
no. unlucky. i have not been lucky.
saturday?

hi.
all you've got to do is talk to him. but the mayor would hang his own grandmother to be re-elected.
still--
pistols, rifles, carbines ...  i'd be grateful.
sheriff's gold posse... bunch of damn fools who pay $5,000 apiece to the sheriff's reelection. i let 'em practice up out here.
you have the mayfair eyes.   tell me, rowan --- what have those eyes seen that the mind can't fathom...?
words.
food and supplies?  who for?  like starving people?
they own the whole building.  they just move from floor to floor.
if you can't look anymore, i understand...
adam?  don't even think about it. okay? i'm sorry.  i know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if i didn't say it. okay?
wait... wait... just "brother". so i go in. "hello... hi... we loved your guest spot on baywatch... blah blah blah..." whatever. so, i start to read, and, mikey, i was money. i prepared for a week. it's a starring role. i'm crying... the casting director, she starts crying...
i don't know. next time i'll have to check.
how about you? all right?

it's my new perfume.  great white, the man-eater.
screw you!
you asked for it.
i don't set policy.  you have the key?
you bet your boots it does.
phillippe... there is something i hope you understand.  terrible cruelty has been used against you. and... you must understand that you did nothing to deserve it.

if that's your case, you didn't have a case.  i wouldn't believe whatever habighorst said, anyway.
this is usda prime, largely available, beef.  with no notice- able competition, present company excepted...
that's some cold shit.
china town. i need more serum.  what's all this?

yep.
you'll hit us!

no, it sounds idiotic, i know. and you're still the hard-headed scot, aren't you? always were. do you think i'm making it up?
this was my first excuse to get away. i can't exactly use my cell phone.
what are you talking about? where are you?
why not?
i don't know. they might be dead already.
they're putting it on at henley hall. see, open try-outs.
yes.
our lord said just the opposite.
but the plague
you know how rumors start.
that's charlie.  my best friend. he's into beef analogies, partly because he's a butcher's son, and partly because, well, he's just into beef analogies. what can i say? he's also a photographer...
and now jonathan masbath.
what the fuck is that?
i couldn't stop myself.
sam ... we can't outrace them. you'll kill us!
drive faster.
be more specific.
last night in this very restaurant mr. jason hoag paid a very pretty compliment to my right ear.
i don't believe you.
i don't know. it's a mystery
but you work for the casino?
yeah, i'm real sorry to hear that.
where's the body?
but bad judgement.  and now you see how dangerous the consequences can be.
i am going to lock him up.

they're afraid of you, aren't they?
i never said he was an altar boy, okay? but he sent his goons after me!  they tried to kill me!  i'm not kidding!
i don't wanna hurt your feelings.
all right, i'll tell them. they're right here in front.
i am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points. must you flirt?
upset words.
they called here after you left...
i forgot to lock the door.
great. i'll have a bloody mary and a steak sandwich.
no, he's not with a girl.
guess what i'm wearing.
i don't want to hear it anymore.
no, dr. hartdegen, they are not just chickens and roosters.  they are science.  perhaps they aren't "inspiring" to you.  perhaps they don't "challenge" you --
i never join nothin'.
i'm sorry.
what did he do?
she's always been so fantastically devoted to lloyd. i would imagine that only death or destruction could keep her-
okay!
it's craig in there, i can tell.
in case of what?
fuck you!  i'm tired of your goddam accusations!  if you want to arrest me go ahead!  otherwise back off.

oh, yes... yes...
so...you two are in love?
so you think time travel is possible? for people?
it takes even less.
what kind of wife did you say she was?
...no cases over the age of temptation but deliver us eight. from evil. for thine is the kingdom, the power and...
life is confusing, isn't it?
right now.
i don't want old sad bastard music either.  i just want something i can ignore.
whatever. i don't believe this. we're going to a party at remington university tonight and we're brushing up our conversation skills with the scum of the school.

one week old.
well, letty, this does present a liability issue for the hospital.

the computer just translated the goddamn message.  it's not an s.o.s. it was a warning.
we ain't going anywhere.
i know you think it complicates your work, but i'm here to help.
al.

oh, gee, mr. gittes we're going out tomorrow. i know you been real good about it but my cousin auggie's sick.
you once said the reason i beat you was because you wanted me to.
she's not for you.

i'm losing you.
'cept that she lost her money and the sons of bitches stole her wedding ring.  that's when she started shooting.  can't blame her. the ring was all carlos left her when he died.
on the salary he pays me, i can't make my rent without it.
you will. one of these nights you'll wake up and find a junkie tearing your bedroom apart.
you really haven't seen my best side.
minimal.

i know this has been painful, spock. for me too. thank you.
it's always hard to see the young ones called home, especially on an exploding thresher. it's just so odd and gross.
li mu bai has made arrangements. he sent him to wudan mountain.

nothing happened with me and grace this morning.
why don't you try and git you a new dog?
you've really got a problem.
michael's great.  i like michael.
that's not fair. you're taking all the fun out of it.
really? what would it take?
why, why did you start this in the first place, man? they never hurt you.
well, don't get excited about it. we agreed that the merger with the saxonia people must go through.
tell her to go back to resurrection.
any luck?
they used to. today it's not an issue.
i wouldn't bet on that.
aw, shit...  i gotta pee anyway.
promised? who promised?
cortex bonding....possible temporary.  before you report a possible equipment malfunction, you check the subjects....?
no. i quit. take your lame ass ideas, your fake ass toupee, your fat ass wife and your ugly ass kids and shove them.
i can see this is useless.
should i be afraid?
what's to like?
if that's all you got, that's all we got left.
this is just... so...
yes you can. you're going to make it, scully.
and i don't like deviations from plans, leo, as i'm sure you re-...

it's a ketch kelly and i had chartered.
uhura!... where!
i can't forget it. i'm still hungry.

she did that before.
shut up.  cupcake. please. inside.
what about it?
yeah, yeah, yeah.  i know!  wink wink!  nudge nudge!

why do you hate me?  it's gotta be more than me private you, you cop.
right.
what a tragedy... what a waste of a life...
about you and mom?
i want to, bembry, but i can't.
i dunno. i mean, it was kind of preachy. chaos-this, chaos-that. and like, to me, the guy seemed kind of high on himself.
...you know, that's another reason you're probably not in a successful relationship.
yes you did.
throw him out, frank.
when are you gonna see it, john?  she doesn't give a damn about you.
what's he like?
what?! it looks totally normal... what's wrong with it?
i couldn't help it! it was the most fun i've had since i've been in law school. not only was i good enough for warner -- i was better than him. he has to see serious i am now. even donovan was impressed, and he's a total hard-ass.
eleven. in the middle of the party, some gulls came down at the children. and miss daniels was attacked by a gull just yesterday after...

toxicology report came back. kendall's attack was caused by a drug known as anephadrine, maybe you've heard of it. it's for asthmatics. if an epileptic takes enough, it kills them. i checked with the nurses at the hospital -- you're the only other person who visited kendall.
gibarian said he thinks solaris should be destroyed.
who is this madame sconce? let's find her and talk to her.
i can't do it, artoo. i can't go on alone.
then tell me this isn't true! that your concern for your play and career is one thing - and that poor frightened hysterical girl another - and that your concern for her has nothing to do with either your play or your career!
okay.
yet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer.  just be being with me.

uh... nightmare on elm street.
i received this information from an alien.  i was at the paramus holiday inn, i was having a drink in the bar when he approached me and started talking.  then he must have used some sort of ray or a mind control device because he made me follow him to his room and that's where he told me about the end of the world.
you talk to bickerman?

money isn't the only reason people commit murder, miss braslow.
well, mr. feldman, some people have resumes to show.  i've got my own movie.
the prefix code is 16309. all commands from each starship bridge are relayed electronically; each ship has its own prefix combination code...
and they're smart about it. they know when you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated, you need a fall guy and for that to work, you have to have a witness.
do you know what time it is?
sorry.  i'm just a little unclear as to why the museum of natural history would send somebody here.
you mean -- break in?

i talked to him gordo.  i talked to my dad.

what case?
yours was not a solution which would have occurred to a vulcan mentality.
what do you like to eat here?
is she responsible for the punch?
you don't know what they're like. you fall for them and you love 'em - you think it's going to be the biggest thing since the graf zeppelin - and the next thing you know they're borrowing money from you and spending it on other dames and betting on the horses -
you're the one who said he was good looking. you think he's good looking 'cause i know you think he's good- looking. i'll smash his face inside out. i'll make him into dog meat. nobody's gonna think he's good-looking when i get through with him. so you just go ahead and think about who you want.
wow ! santori and zegema beach, i've always wanted to go there.
what. what's the matter?
maybe it would if i took it.
that's it then. that's it. i've always been alone. that's why i'm a good driver. i can handle it. see, i can think on my feet. i survive, i'm a thinker. and i can sit there in front of your house for two hours and it don't bother me. some people can't do it! some people are ranting and raving, "tell them fuckin' people to get out here and get in this car, i can't-- i want a go!" where you gonna go? you're gonna wind up back in your garage at seven o'clock at night. you ain't going nowhere. you leave your house in the morning you get back to your house in the evening. what's the big deal, right?
i'm impressed: i don't think evelyn's ever said those words to anything with genitalia.
one of the other nuns found out about the baby and... and wanted to avoid a scandal.

why not?
i know you do, lou.  i'm doing three more lectures this month.  you're all doing an incredible job, sue, al, numa.  but this is one where if you don't nail the other guy, you're dead.  how did jack ruby dies so quick?  of what?  cancer, right?  a history of nazi germany, lou.  they were studying viral cancers as a weapon in the 30's.  we learned a lot more than you think from the nazis.  read this. our biological warfare lab is in fort detrick, maryland.  close to where the national cancer institute is located.  think about it.  think the unthinkable - question everything.
jesus, bill, you got fever. take a drink, will you?
what do you want?
i don't like him.
gale!  this is for you.  i want you to know i never meant to hurt you. this will explain everything.

fine.
sure - sure. don't you worry. i'll take care of you.
no. no.  don't joke about that. that's not funny, claudia.  please, now.
pffft!  absolute nonsense.  the quarter is filled with vivid imaginations, my dear mr. garrison - grimy young hoodlums who'll say and do anything.  as you well know.
i keep it for emergencies.
it tells me what every face tells me.  everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  what is it you want?
all i get are the orientals. they can build 'em, but they can't drive 'em so? what are you doing here? what's with the outfit -- ?
well, then -- if you're feeling up to it, maybe we should talk shop.
what?
yeah!
and that's all the gratitude i get for saving your hide.
you don't think weapons are important?
oh no.
another minute.  please --
and you too, ninotchka.
i wanted to talk to you.

i'm sorry about blake.
has ray come in yet?
okay. figure it forgotten. what's this about anyways -- ?
and those who explode bombs in public places, do they perhaps respect the law? when you asked that question to ben m'hidi, remember what he said? no, gentlemen, believe me, it is a vicious circle. and we could discuss the problem for hours without reaching any conclusions. because the problem does not lie here. the problem is: the nlf wants us to leave algeria and we want to remain. now, it seems to me that, despite varying shades of opinion, you all agree that we must remain. when the rebellion first began, there were not even shades of opinion. all the newspapers, even the left-wing ones wanted the rebellion suppressed. and we were sent here for this very reason. and we are neither madmen nor sadists, gentlemen. those who call us fascists today, forget the contribution that many of us made to the resistance. those who call us nazis, do not know that among us there are survivors of dachau and buchenwald. we are soldiers and our only duty is to win. therefore, to be precise, i would now like to ask you a question: should france remain in algeria? if you answer "yes," then you must accept all the necessary consequences.

i don't know what to say...
you must.  luke, look at me!
be reasonable, boys -- this isn't the time or the place to do some kind of half-assed autopsy on a fish. ben...  do you have all the pictures you need?
how is my dear friend benjamin feeling?
but i understand her. that may be more important.
that would be a pity because you're a real painter.
but john hasn't got any.
she's not that either.
no.  i have to stay functional until my mission is complete.  then it doesn't matter.
i'm not telling.
no thanks, not hungry. harry dunne. why does that name not sound familiar?
they'll never make it. i mean, they can't manage when the cable goes out.

i would say, in those days, he was a muscular actor, in every sense, with all the presence of someone like cooper or lancaster, but combined with a sly wit to make him a formidable romantic lead, closer in that respect to cary grant.

and what would be of greater help, than to release her, from the bonds of this sordid earthly existence.  don't you think?  in which the innocent are tortured in ways which would make the anguish of the damned seem tame and unimaginative, don't you <u>think</u>?  blind him again, and prepare <u>him and her</u> for the pigs!

it's not done.
and i am the falcon, winged lord of the sky!
oh harry, you're so funny. now i have something that's kind of delicate...
francis. you gonna leave the seeds in there? in the binding like that?
evan. stop it. it's not the time.
good advice for the french, not for the english!  do you think god hates the english?
no--no.
navigation control tried to hail the vessel. this was the only response.
you're welcome.
i am see-threepio, human-cy...
the kind where there isn't really an answer.
just reporters.
don't you know?
i see.
it's more like a mental block.  when i'm with girls, it does nothing to me.
shit... i thought they was gonna get us. i was even... scared a little... just for a minute.  was you ever scared in them days?
we got a loose cannon here. and we're out a bunch of money, and the other party is out his product.
what's the matter... they never housebroke you?
it's not gonna take long, sam.
yeah-well, you wanted to keep the relationship flexible, remember? it's your phrase.
no.
and i love what you're wearin'.
know what?
you?
um, i think the warren commission has been closed for a while.
no.
sounds like a russian general.
the red knight!
yes, i will.
i know about you.
enchanté.  alain, j'ai réfléchi à votre proposition et j'ai décidé d'accepter.
hey, but did we get to you, klute? a little?
good luck.
she cannot possibly refuse.  her family is poor, they have even less money than we do.  and along with the invitation, the king sent the diamond pendant, from the piglet.
hush your mouth.
yeah?  and what are you going to do tonight?
by the way--did you hear a shot last night?
who was this partner of his?
white-walls?
but... but....but.... you're <u>right</u>.  i used it.  to <u>bargain</u>.  for her <u>sympathy</u>...  i <u>used</u> it--to "whore myself out"-- 
couldn't happen to a nicer guy.  you know, you're the only one around here who ever takes his hat off in the elevator.
how much? how much do you wanna bet?
what'll i tell him?
is he in pain?
then you think it might have worked out?
i wouldn't bring you here on a hoax. houston confirms the telemetry and i.d. codes.
... tired.  must... lie down.
up ribbon!
now he's back.
it sounds nice.
how come i got to shh? run out, didn't he?
just one question.  since dr. argon no longer has feeling below his waist, how is it that you're still able to do your job?
still, there have been rewards.  it's sunny.  and some of the producers who call even have credits.
i heard it.
coffee and whiskey, lucky you ain't dead with that diet. wait, i've got it. half fried chicken with fries. let's go, hurry up. come on.

bring the age of ragnarok to an end and stop all this fighting and bloodshed.
you haven't changed at all! some guy tries to rape me -- and you side with him!
i know.
it's three in the morning.    not much else to do.
the kid said --
ah yes, the lady is waiting.
evil.
i can't!
oh, jabez -- it was a wonderful day --
i don't suppose i could watch.
who?
what?
time!
don't you think his girl friend's beautiful?
no one could've found those splinters without a machine like this and no one has a machine like this.
no.  look, we're kind of....
what do you mean, "you"?
what do you suggest, lieutenant? opening fire won't retrieve the captain; and an armed engagement was precisely what he wished to avoid.
i called bucky's. i got her a cab. is there any hot mustard?
okey-doke.
what was it then?
mama mia.  just because you were a nerd once doesn't mean it's going to happen again. that's why you have me for fashion consultation.
it's a shame.  he's such a rest actor, and nobody uses him anymore.

what's on your mind? don't --
yes, honey.  i think we both can.
mayonnaise? donald loved mayonnaise. why would you think that was the problem.?
sorry i got you up, boy. go back to sleep. yeah, be glad to.  said to give you his regards.

please.  just tell me what’s happening to me. in plain english.  none of that mumbo jumbo...
yeah, mack?
fine. my mistake. you know, i'm gonna be a writer myself some day.
i could not come.  i had other responsibilities.
'cause if you were asleep -- i'm sorry. and you could be grouchy.
each to his fate. wait for me at the inn. if i am not back by dawn, you will know my fate, and you must go on without me.
i ain't drunk, honey.
he wants to know who you are. your name. i told him we don't need to know anything about you.
all right.  i'll go up, then you send up the gold and--
not directly anyhow ...
it's me, honey. it's mom.
i don't watch tv and i hate books. whatta you need?
tracks your location to the inch and works directly with--you know...
there's no lady here.
...push this? oh. it's working. hello, martin?
take my advice.  and shoot that dog.  or let me.
he was watching me.
oh yeah?
sweet grace?  what about her?
yes, eve?
have you any money?
i want to be john malkovich. tomorrow morning. plus i'd like to meet this partner of yours.
well, what's the matter?
i don't know. i don't know.
and after that?
we're coming with you.
right. it's crazy. but here's the beauty part. ready?  who cares?
father's friend.
why did they built it?
it must end here... or i am the future.
you tell them the day after the assassination you were called on the phone by this "clay bertrand" and asked to fly to dallas and be lee oswald's layer.
hugh kane.
where are you going?
too bad, i liked her.  so, you're all alone in the house of pain?
look, man, i'm the bachelor, alright? i gave her a hundred bucks in tips alone --
you killed a prostitute.
i don't think i belong here.
come on. just tell me. it'll save all the trouble of you showing me all the rooms.
why the math?
i don't. i have my own.
i would have killed him.
oh, out a ways.  maybe the lighthouse.
listen, i'm busy. nobody has access to those files except studio execs. can you please go away now?
it's all so complicated.
are you ok?
the one i got they wouldn't let me read.  it began, "ninotchka, my darling," and ended, "yours, leon."
at present, he's surrounded by a magnetic shield. if my calculations are correct, he should be deep into his escape planning by this time.
28 is do something illegal. 42 is befriend an enemy.
lay them down.
no  there is something...something there i can't tell... i can't describe it.  there are things there.... but i'm... here.
i've been to church hill.
that's okay.  you alright down here by yourself?
too bad.  we'd be out of here in a few hours.
yeah.
any ghosts in here?
what is that? a pencil that writes in ink?
little boys. looking up my skirt as i danced. giggling.
where are you transmitting from?
even if they are iraqis probably all they'll do is take us prisoner for awhile.  got to figure we're still kicking their asses in the war.  they don't want any trouble.
oh darling, of course it would. if it isn't - there are six rooms and two baths - but if that isn't enough, mother will give us the blue room too, i think.
you were trying to make me look bad.
even if all this were true. there're 20 other buildings. all of them filled with computers and --
good night, then.
i am.  he has always been our greatest protector.
what kind of look?
what about a reward for coming forward?
borrow whatever you like.
you remember this?
why --
you gotta get out of here.
they love you, lib.  keep it up.
how are they going to do it?
you did. joe no i didn't. you said   something first.
your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should.  science can create pesticides, but it can't tell us not to use them.  science can make a nuclear reactor, but it can't tell us not to build it!
what?  tony and china, together?
i'd like to hit this guy on a gut level.
i’m impressed. that information could have cost me £20,000.
frogs. they copy our blue jeans and when we need their help in kuwait, where the fuck are they?
now you've got all the ones with beards on one side and all the moustaches on the other.
bosun!  set up mr. sparrow's quarters, nice and fine ... in the brig.  meaning no disrespect, of course.
you can't. so tell me what you do know -- say it!
you must be joking -  when there's a woman involved - there's no stopping me. now, let me have that sheet.
billy!  please!
no, thank you -- what's your name?
yesterday.
so this break... is a break-up.
but you're not going to stop her?
yeah -- see the fight last night? apollo creed beat that english guy bad.
yeah, baby. things are great. listen, there's devra, whatta you want?
'bye, jeff.
i'm going to work in washington, cindy.
the accent, i suppose.
-- oh, yes, it's mad.
you're going to live here permanently?
since when do you care about the homeless?
really.
and if he doesn't make it -- ?
if you don't mind my saying so, sir, i don't see how anyone could live in this forsaken place.
are you okay?
i don't know.  it wouldn't be very smart.
uh - oh - hi!  my name is brad majors. and this is my fiancee, janet weiss.  i - ah - wondered if you could help us.  our car has broken down about two miles up the road.  do you have a phone we might use?
really? perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction?
that is correct.  lieutenant dunbar, i came to apologize for the accommodations. ordinarily, of course, we never put officers up with enlisted men.
you have to. we're trying to contact the ship. if we do, i'll let you know immediately. good luck.
waitaminit, dudes! i got it! maybe we can glue the tickets back together!
there are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed.
i haven't drunk this much since-
no.  i'm fine.
khambas are wild men.
dead?
this is not an intelligent way to approach this.
how's it hanging, miles?
what are you saying?
kay told me.  she comes to me, you know. tells me things.  about you.  about me.
you sure looked it. something go wrong?
what else?  you gonna leave some cash by the bed when you pass through town?
and what was that, john?
right.
i'm just preoccupied.
hey, no kidding? where are your offices?
guenevere. and a beloved friend who will betray you.
this isn't simulation anymore. take'er out easy, cadet.
blow it up?
tuck that shirt in, david lee.
why?
it's bad business.
i think so.
fighters closing fast - range fifty miles.
business was fine.  i'll tell you what, you couldn't pay me enough to live down there.
i never made that claim.
did i say anything was wrong? i just sponged up a little too much vat 69, okay? i'm down to my last nickel in this lousy town, i can't get my luggage outta hock 'cause i met this jerk who said he was a record producer when all he had was a record.  he offered to set me up for life, and like a fool, well, i...
none of your business, now go away. you're throwing my game off.
toward the pole!
hi.
you got a back door to this place?
i think you'll do very well.
yeah.
you didn't. i would think with all this on your mind, you'd wait till after.
you know, i really do like a woman with tits like yours that talks tough and acts like she can fuck like a bunny... can you fuck like that?... you like it like a bunny?... huh?... cause baby, i'll fuck you like a real good like a big ol' jack-rabbit bunny... jump all around in that hole... bobby peru doesn't come up for air.
that never changes.  you know, when you and grandma are gone, the family's gone. i never see the cousins anymore.
chuckie, what are you talkin'...
i don't like that word prank, bob. i was trying to do something more than a prank.
no, but i'm the best.
offend a reputable citizen and involve the department in a slander suit? no. i'm in office to protect the taxpayers money — not throw it way. come on, charlie.
yeah?
incredible.  we should take a drive before they're gone.  spend the night at some cozy little bed and breakfast.
oooooweee!!  you shoulda seen me! like i'd been doin' it all my life! nobody would ever believe it.
you see all those guys with gold on their shoulders!!?... oh, no, i think that was johnson, air boss of the kitty hawk!
what the hell is this all about?
what's your cost?
i suggest you just give him the photos and have done with it.
let him answer.
c'mon, rufus, you've been busted twice for felony hacking.
i think so, daughter.  how old are you?
no.  of course not.  don't listen to him.  he's - he's...  ... my brother.
it's not even a good picture. looks to mature.
thirty-five.
how do you like it?
he's downstairs.
i can't believe it, daddy. i know it must be true, but i can't believe it.
get out of my car!
i must be insane.  leaving work, ditching cops.  all to follow a murderer.  a very old murderer, but a murderer just the same.
i've known susan for more than fifteen years.  james, we're old allies.
catch me letting you go alone!
i wanted to be alert for your visit today.  especially since i saw so little of you in the hospital.
no.
i didn't tell anybody. i just went for a walk and happened to be passing by . . .
agent mackelway, you're going to get your wish. you're going back to washington. i want you back in computer crimes. fire up those chat rooms.
maybe yes. maybe no.
good.
how do you draw now?
we're gonna operate together.
who?
remind me to lodge a protest...
get all the big bills in the place. take them out and get them changed. get nothing but ones and fives. distribute them among the tellers. tell them to take their time. stall as much as possible. count and recount the money.
and i'd like your help, determining who's bidding for their purchase.
very early. dawn.
you're welcome.  you shouldn't give up on performing.
live there?
sir ?
radar, he's underwater.  but he's definitely coming.
get mom.
it's all we've got.
that ain't the worst part.  her little sister, baby d.  she's the one that gets real physical.  but i got a restraining order on her, too.
oh, no, no, no.  he's my sister's husband.  and i think if you gave him half a chance, you'd like him. he's very intelligent.
she's coming with us.
please. why not?
what signs?
my husband will be back quite late.
can't.
thank you, uncle elliot.
claudia, you torture yourself.
then come for dinner.
yeah?
i'm not ... i'm not ... you're gettin' a bus ... you're gettin' a bus ... the jet's comin' into kennedy ... and your wife's on the way ... what else do you need? what else can i get you?  listen, i don't know how you can do better ... see that man over there ... the fbi guy ...
why do you think she is a witch?
i can't find it.
transmit a wide band co-variant signal. that'll get his attention.
don't worry. thanks.
what's your problem?
yeah.
what desert?
oh, your excellency, you take me off my feet.
i was here!
there was that ammunition train in the depot at frankfurt, see? so dunbar gets himself in the men's room and fixes a time bomb, see? then he waits until the train starts moving out, see? and one of the cars got the door open with some straw on the floor, see? so he throws it, see, and three minutes later -- voom! see?
that's right.
fine, i'll go by myself then...
when do these hot-headed boys of yours go on the road?
lombardo's settlement?
i read the file.  yeah.  marx and towler.  i know who they were.
that's not my ring.
better if i just show you.
are you vice?
can i ask you something?  you only had one crew on the date rape piece, right?
he what?
you white folks don't understand the natural beauty of a woman's figure. those are birthing hips. more cushion for the pushin'.
give who a tail?
we ain't got it. we ain't got no money.
what's the matter with you?
and you'll face that danger head-on.  as if i could stop you.  and you have my complete support in this matter. anything you can do to revitalize this neighborhood would be a blessing.
who wrote it?
look after that suit, eh. barbara chose it for me.
this one can.
you can't count on very many people, that's the trouble.  number of times a decent job's been cocked up ...
we sure like havin' you.
it might be an interesting case.
whatever was on that bridge wasn't weir.
no.  it's my life.
i don't know about us, but i know he's-a got something...
it's not like you're going to lose anything. you can ask anyone in town. i've been nothing if not generous. i want the best for everyone.
i mean, if i said it, wouldja believe me?  ya wouldn't, would ya?
that's great if you're a computer. in the real world that pane weighs 200 pounds. the building's 600 feet high.
ok.  that's true.  is anyone else, besides me and besides you in this house?
in fact, reduced, bu five dollars!
he's into his wind-up. here comes the pitch. strike on the inside corner!
see the cross of the lord. be gone you hostile power. o'lord hear my prayer.
i'm trying to.
call the ranch, tell beynotr we'll leave his cut here --
don't worry.  we'll take it out of your share.
i guess that's all of it.
no, mother.
you bet.
yeah, right.
no, you're shielding her. let her face the world.
motherhood.
good morning.
yes, we've got a 4:30 train to catch. why?
what?
the bullet came out clean, but he lost a whole lot of blood. praying wouldn't hurt.
i'm here, honey. i'm right here.
surf's up.
what responsibility? you're closing the fucking store to play hockey.

not disintegrating, alan -- digitizing. while the laser is dismantling the molecular structure of the object, the computer maps out a holographic model of it. the molecules themselves are suspended in the laser beam. then the computer reads the model back out, the molecules go back into place, and...  voila.
just tell me we're still in the shipping lane. just show me all those stars, all those bright, beautiful, deep-space....
where is it?
i didn't fly up here to roast marshmallows--
what about hard work?
what possible purpose could a duplicate village have except... to deceive the ba'ku...
congratulations.
i'm making <u>you</u> nervous.  i'm the one with a schedule.
right, right-- i like that stuff.
one way, or round trip?
on what?
what?
to hell with sex.
no, don't know who he is.  do you?
there's no mirror.
you don't know a name off-hand you like better, do you, diz?
the first couple, yes, but after that it became increasingly difficult.
first of all, richard is not a creep. he happens to be an exceptional person. if any of you gave him half a chance, you'd find that out.
back up!  back...
orson wells?  what about doctor lizardo?
i know we are. but as the years go by, we become even worse. isn't that so, corrado?
he's conducting experiments of his own.
you're coming with me?
it's the right thing to do.
why not? please - it would help me
i'm beginning to think it doesn't mean anything.  remember eventually revenge- -
of course it is.
what's that?
uh, yeah, that's...wow.
no…not really.
it shouldn't be too much longer.  once the roads are open, the lines'll be up in no time. if you give me their numbers, i'll keep trying them for you.  could i ask you a favor?  i noticed in your case there was a new paul sheldon book and...  and i wondered if maybe... 
you'd think so.
hey kid, it's me, bill munny.
this whole thing is goin' down tonight. i need to know where the ambassador is gonna be. the feds will be keepin' a lid on everything. you thing you can do that?
then why send me back to them?!
nick, we can't just --

so you better leave.
saturday night's the 'springtime in paris' dance. i'm taking suzy parker.
does dorothy know her husband is dead?
morning, doc.  awful early, aren't ya?
when i was in high school we used to come up here and make out. i liked to sit on the rock and watch the sun go down.
you've heard of mail-order brides? well they go that way, too.
where are we going?
i'd say logic more than faith.  the odds were on my side.
how can i believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you?
we're doing dusk-till-dawn taping of all the places where there've been alleged blair witch "sightings" --the parr house, coffin rock, tappy creek.
yeah...

you won't find them. won't find west, either. he's too good.
look, if you won't believe me, go ahead. you can help me make beds if you like.  come on.
sam called me. from tri-tech. he says you start working for them next week.
well...
but where would we go?
yale thing?
is that a threat, dr. bright?
you're not paying for this. it's quite enough that you let me sit at your table.
forty-four. they're on special this week from the canary islands. a real bargain.
you know what they say about the early bird.
kid--he thinks he's talking to that mob at home, but not a line we've written--not a word he's said from that floor has gotten into that home state.

a pass? how you gonna give me a pass? a witness can put me at the crime scene.

we're going for a walk.
yes.
anything you hurl them at will turn to stone.

not much.
go easy on jay bird.  i can remember when we was his age...
don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give me a big head.  the important thing, doctor, is you've got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off.
i'm sorry mr. kesher, but there seems to be some problem concerning your credit card.
and what in your estimation works?
i was in the army too.  and i'm good with crowds.
i haven't the slightest idea.
why should i trust you?
half a flounder. hmmm... a burlap bag... a paint can... aha!
fine.
then why do you hate me so much?
well, for the same reasons we do, sir. don't you see?
you shouldn't go alone.  he might claim that you tried to black mail him.

i'll just drive my car.
yes! what are you afraid of hildy? i dare him to move that desk out of here.
-- and if he were in the midst of making love while under the influence of cocaine?
i'll marry you if it turns out you have no blood at all.
three's a crowd. yes, i'm aware of that. but i have to keep an eye on mr. benjamin wherever he goes. to make sure he doesn't get himself into trouble.
it was in her favorite handbag -- and, mr. doyle, that can lead to only one conclusion.
yes. and i know you.

on the dog watch, night after the storm, i look down into the skylight above skipper's cabin and there she was, peelin' down.
jimmy!  this is a coincidence.  i am just going -
yeah.
must be the music room.
the police department?
amy, it's me.  listen very carefully..
okay.
but you will always be here?
that said, the whole point of an election is to choose winners, and that you have done.  we'll begin with president.
well, i'd have to see it, of course.
joey got cut off before he got to that part. check it out. by this point, it's already running at, what, twice the speed as when it started.
sure, but what is this?
up there!!
i been told to take your car in, sir.
i don't know, though, i feel so guilty because alvy is paying for it, so, you know, so i do feel guilty if i don't go to bed with him. but if i do go to bed with him, it's like i'm going against my own feelings. i don't know i-i can't win.
thanks, but you have a good time.
i'm sorry. i guess i'm just tired of hearing about mr. carpenter.  i don't like the way he's attached himself to you and bobby. after all, what do you know about him?
bull. that ain't right... government sends people there all the time, just don't want us to know about it.
mark...
i just don't want natalie to ever find out.  she deserves better.
it's taken care of.
it's locked.
here's to ed.  for making us into something.
james looks twice?
you've spent your life avoiding this. you'll try hard to deny it; you're quite likely to destroy it.
sure, sure, just the money, and the aristocratic pleasure of seeing him fall apart. you're a roman, bert. you have to win them all.
you got it back, eh? there's something funny going on around here.
what the hell is this?
has the patient in twenty-one gotten his tray yet?
his dead body with a bullet in it.
let's hope so. sally if he asks me again, i'm gonna tell him i returned it all.
you can call me ostreicher.
you heard, it gets on my wick.
want to know what, exactly?
sikh.  if he wears a turban, he's a sikh.
life is a burden for me.  nothing gives me any pleasure; i find only sadness in everything around me.  it is very difficult because the ways of those with whom i live, and probably always shall live, are as different from mine as moonlight is from sunlight.
i can probably get you in there. just let me talk to dennis taylor.
i want to do this for you.  i want to do something good for a change.
did the boy say that any of them are in immediate danger?
no... for god's sakes, santos!
you know, it's going to take me a while to get used to calling you pete.  pete.  pete.  it's a nice name.
a soft side? who knew?
i didn't aim to.
hurry...
any time.
you don't know where this is gonna...
that's right.
four times... so far.
do you think the truth will come out at the trial?
"insane?" the finest astronauts fought to be posted to this ship. it would take the lewis and clark a thousand years to reach our closest star. the event horizon could be there in a day...
oui.  now you've got me talking french.
i'm sorry to hear that.
smell?  uh, something like methylcyanoacrylate.
yeah. seems maranzano wants to talk about buying the merchant street warehouse.
no, i guess i've been no help at all to you.
russia.
jimmy, my daddy's still alive and it kind of gives me the creeps when you do that...
it was amazing.
no fucking.
what little dogs?
yes.
excuse me, vendela, have you seen diane? we're supposed to go to the homecoming dance tonight.
of course, it's madison!!! who else could it be?
she was unconscious, patrick.
it ain't so bad, 'cause i was a nothin' before --
the door, michael.  find the key...
but the point is dickie -- well we know this -- dickie loves marge and he misses her and apparently he's come to his senses...
i have no idea what he's doing then. i'm sorry that didn't work out.
jack, it's all over the papers. he's an obvious type.  but this indian...
the wedding, my parents, your family, our friends, my job, the future, our relationship, the caterers, my gown, your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the apartment, my shower, your bachelor party...
a guy that'd fall in love with your daughter should have his head examined.
i'm just sayin' -- it was a steep hillside.  there was no moon that night ...
where's ken? is he all right?
there's practically a whole book about how that statistic is not true --
girls, i wanta apologize.  for my language back there.
i think it's fantastic.
thank you for seeing me.  i hear your wedding day is near.  you must be overwhelmed by the preparations.
say how they find their way back home.
that's terrific.  that's really terrific, but i notice i'm the one that's cleaning up this--  oh, crap, i'll have to do this one over.
what?
jeff for senator.
what?
sang? his name is a past tense?
i don't want names!  just lead me to him.  where's their nest?
don't lie, taylor. i just had this blattis guy on the phone asking me for a comment - you gave him the whole damned case!
what would you like to be?
honestly harry, he got the mustang, i promise.....
for good luck honey.
that sure looks like fun...  you know how long it's been since i was behind the wheel?
my husband the hero.
that means you won't have a gun.
i see...
what would it take to buy our stock back?  name your price.
no more words.  until i touch the ocean with my hands... it's all just words.
it's always locked.
these guys were pros. i think they were coming for one target, the fag man, he was the...
what is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
carter.  i just want to be able to tell the ambassador who was responsible for the death of his daughter because he talked too much.
no.
yeah, morgan. it's a real rarity that we'd be out drinkin'.
walking where?
what, it's broken?
she's the scream queen.
oh shit.  you said "boss."
louder.
yeah...
what is happening?
you're out! i'm not working with either one of you!
oh, let me go and have a bit of peril?
i'm a professional, eddie. getting paid is all the thanks i require.
that smell's still fillin' this room good.
i don't have much time. 
major, that's all i've been told.  just got it on the red phone.  the base is to be sealed tight.  and i mean tight.
but it still doesn't make them saints. they still have to get up and piss in the middle of the night, don't they? they can still be vindictive and envious and mean just like you and me. well, just like me. can't they?
didn't think it was my buddy over there.
you'll have to be more specific than that, sir.
well, she isn't just any woman.
four hundred, delmar.
oh, would you grow up.
sir! sir, i'm sorry! he didn't mean it! he was trying to get me.
of course.
listen, stupid - right now spats colombo and his chums are looking for us in every male band in the country.
greta, come on.  one burger with me?
there'll be red flags.
it's an honor.
which would force our delegates in philadelphia to vote for independence.
baby, we're money.
i didn't say fuck him. i'm just not connected anymore.
cliff brumby. he'd seen the film. he wanted to meet doreen.
yes, you do. it's very discreet. there's no names in the papers. you don't have to worry about any of that stuff.
oh, ben -- this is so -- exciting --
anything?
yep. that's the best way. it's that boom boom boom.
i feel like i need you dad's permission just to kiss you. jody, it's time to assert yourself to be a big girl. an individual. i'm going to this party tonight. jimmy's my ride. come over to my house after school. we'll go together.
yes.   we've all got to let go.
perhaps.  but on the off-chance that it is a 'doomsday device' of some kind, i plan to be very far away from your lovely texas when it is activated.
i don't have the experience.  father thomas should officiate.
then leave her to me.
i don't know. and you know what's scary--when you get older it just gets more confusing. i've spent the last ten years with women who are basically all wrong for me.  you know what, i shouldn't be talking about this stuff with you.
ride with me. we need a haircut.
he seems like he thrives on danger
watch it, partner, watch it!
some cling to sanity through time with the one continuity and trad0 ition their lives have known: the game.  you and i conor, we are different from all others around us.  you know this, you can feel it.  we are flesh and bone like any man, but unlike our neighbors we are rather difficult to injure,  permanently.
no. it didn't, buff.
you know what?  why don't you just pick me up here? we could all share a limo.
i'll talk to her, i'll reason with her.
why are you doing this to me? i'll give you whatever...
sure...
guards come exactly every three minutes....
why do you want to know?
sshhh! he's in there.
get the fuck outta here!
yeah, let's check out the low-life.
you didn't come to talk about the weather, surely.
to see a man about a thing.
how the hell am i gonna do that?
i still don't under --
cards for sorrow, cards for pain.
--i know!
laura.
doesn't matter who he is. he is what we would call a legitimate target.
...how do we explain that?  with the world watching.
shucks.  guess not.
larry, we can re-open the beaches in august.
well... uh... thanks...
oh brother. dorothy vallens, seventh floor. look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
right, bob.
pitch-black?! it -
i didn't miss it.  i figured if you knew one of the reserves got hit you'd want to turn back.
i've got a job.
abbe, i admire you; i do. you've a conviction... an idealism... peculiar to the very young. and so i'll be candid. the ministry has sent me here with the most explicit... the most severe instructions.
i know very well what you're talking about. you're talking about something you can't get your fingers on, and it's galling you. that's what you're talking about, i know.  well, i've said too much. i . . . you're the board here. you do what you want with this thing. just one thing more, though. this town needs this measly one-horse institution if only to have some place where people can come without crawling to potter. come on, uncle billy!
what was i supposed to do?
who the hell is he?
then don't sweat it, george, you know why?
it would've happened years ago if you hadn't carried him.  why the loyalty, wendell?
sure, i'll take her up right now.
yes?
yes, it was -- i ended up --
help me put him back in his chair.
you're saying that christ is the child, and --
all right. now finish your drink.
well, bravo!  what with you and whistler's ma - i think i've got a winning team.
no, it's okay.  after all, he is the president, right?
i could do it if i tried. even kelly thinks so.
what about what?
what do you want?
why would they fire at him without provocation?
i didn't.  i figured you leave it well enough alone.
no.
what happened?
i forgot to mention.  jed called --
dad.
roger that.
i can't --
surgical.  look at them separate the dye packs.  dick and ronny know their jobs.
i love you when you're angry.
they never wrote you nothing?
and still the film is number one at the box office this weekend. beat out american pasty and arlington street.
yes, i know them --
yah?  well, even the best mom in the world, the smartest, the wisest, whatever.  needs to know when to find a plan b.  cos plan a <u>is</u> not and <u>will</u> n...
oh, no -- please.  i have to rest for just a minute.  toto!
jesus, look at that wall.  place almost looks like a prison.
won't?  or can't?
plastique explosive shoelaces.  cut them to regulate the size of the blast; totally harmless until you attach the detonator hidden in the heel of your shoe.
well, what? is he dangerous?
really?
she ain't missing so much as she's run away.
okay... would you rather... commit yourself sexually to a four-by-nine cell with former president george herbert walker bush dressed as a super-model for a month, or make love to a otter on crank for a week?
she don't look no worse to me.
stealing his arms?
i don't hear anything.  you were dreaming.  or maybe the wind blew something over.
why should i?
transfer.
and... what does jeanne think?
read the newspapers.
i'm sure he's busy.
yeah so? the guy's beat up - he...he probably has a concussion or something, right?  he'll snap out of it?
the whale!  how could i forget? always was something fishy about that woman!
get the fuck out of here, honey... what do we got?
i don't know what's going on, but if you people have tripped over your own asshole again, you're not gonna get any help from us. it's ending at your doorstep.
that could be a good sign, though. it could mean that he got away.
don't c-cross the road if ya can't get out of the kitchen.
you're coming here?
not yet.
oh gracious no. not with his blandishments.
yes.
afraid not.  you can pick your friends, but you can't pick your family.
no fucking way.
no. keep all energy to the armor.
"i gotta go see about a girl"? what did they say?
did he mention anything about having an exhibition of his work?
how long 'til they reach us?
maybe you can tell me what he's been doing in that silo. we heard some explosions out there this morning...
...you know, they're- the-the horrible would be like, uh, i don't know, terminal cases, you know?
don't you get along with your parents?
you're a better man than i am, charlie brown.
no.
admiral, i asked you a question.
cut it out butt-hole!
i'm asking.
very good, sir.
i'm not saying it's a bad thing, in fact, i think it's something we should take pride in.  i'm going to give the last brownie as a prize to the saddest act here.
what was his name?
hey, the fda screwed me on that when they changed the law, and you know it!  anyway, 'least i try shit, still got some dreams left... you're a goddamn waitress, what do you got?
i just saw the mayor, he said anything we...
it's midnight, harry. my glittering raiments are dissolving.
what did it say?
your lip's stopped bleeding, too, george.
no.  are you going to the correspondents' dinner on saturday?
taylor, you surprise me.
hang on, burt.  the bastards are up to something.
what?
but what if andy gets another dinosaur?  a mean one?  i just don't think i can take that kind of rejection.
and i can go free?
lemme tell it, tommy.
maybe.
no -- she asked me about cocaine.
naturally.
i do, i do...
because i've already found the most wonderful libretto!
i’m not trying to knock the tire business, jack.
i want to see.
...let live.
no.
see, i was the opposite. i never understood why anyone would want to go into space. it's so dangerous. you do one thing wrong and you're dead. the astronomer -- or the paleontologist -- get to study these amazing things from a place of complete safety. and truthfully, everything you really need to learn, you can learn it from the ground.
mrs. macdougall, i think it is only fair to warn you that you are now alone with a notorious sexpot.
a bereavement. a death in the family.
aye, sir.
you're outnumbered kat two to one, got to go with the majority, that's democracy.
jack?  jack was a pimp.  a bagman in dallas for the mob.  he used to run guns to castro when he was still on our side.  check out jack youngblood. shit - we almost had castro.  then we tried to whack him.  everybody's flipping sides all the time.  it's fun 'n' games, man fun 'n' games.
fight fire with fire.  threaten to go to her husband.
who?
ted, get a grip on yourself.  you should never have left the hospital.
i not only say it, i'll back it up twenty buck's worth.
three hundred?
you said there were none.
it's comin' along... want a beer?
je n'ai jamais vu tant de sérenité. elle m'a demandé de tes nouvelles et si nous étions heureux.
you do the right thing. sit with me while i heal, let it develop slow.
yeah, why?
we know so little about each other --
sig ep's gotta band, tonight.
excellent.  we'll have a most interesting time.
i wish i could be like my momma though. she always knew what was wrong. knew just what to say.
maybe.
i know it!
i don't know what misguided impulse caused you to pull that ridiculous stunt, mr. dalton, but, whatever it was, i hope you've learned your lesson.
oh, don't be silly.
no, but at least i wonder sometimes -- instead of doing that "one for one" song of yours. you sound like a sleepteacher with a stuck tape.
i don't know.  it was walled over.  no one's been down there in years.
he said, and these were his words, he <u>valued</u> our time together, because i was civil.
that's wonderful, miss van deusen...what's it about?
why, i think it's very sweet of the children--
let's go.
...and my need for the institution...
could be.  do you play the market?
i suppose not.
just come to the mudd club on friday.
that's right.  it's a crime.  it is a crime.  it's also very safe.
why, thank you, david.
do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?
you can make a mistake.
such pretty knees for a big boy!
let's see...  next you tell me all the terrible things about you - and prove that we're doomed to fail - right...?   you hate kittens and puppies, you've drivin all your lovers to suicide --and those mysterious deaths at the hospital were really -
we deny nothing! we have the right to preserve our race!
borrowed.
how do you know?
mrs. macneil the problem with your daughter is not her bed, it's her brain.
yeah. i knew you'd catch on eventually.
yes, i guess i do.
whatever.  come on, who is this?  i think you have the wrong number.
the word is sick.  ted -- very, very, very sick.
i can't quite explain it, but everything is somehow familiar. the very air that i breathe. the lamasery, with its feet rooted in the good earth of this fertile valley, while its head explores the eternal. all the beautiful things i see, these cherry blossoms, you - all somehow familiar.  i've been kidnapped and brought here against my will. a crime, a great crime, yet i accept it amiably, with the same warm amiability one tolerates only from a very dear and close friend. why? can you tell me why?
what did you say?
sit down, please.
listen, i bag this stuff anyway.  it may as well pay my rent.
gone.
yes i did.    lose ends are messy.
is it me you're hiding from them or the other way around?
good night, steve.
inside.
no, it's all right. what's wrong, adam?
get me ten bags of mulch.
i got it.  you like sting but you don't like gram parsons, because you've never heard of him.
and what do you expect? who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day?
where is she?
i forgave you the moment you said it.
seven eighty-five out of twenty.  take care of yourself now, and don't do anything i wouldn't do.
let some time pass... then ask, quietly, without anyone knowing it comes from me.
fine with me.  but i'm afraid you'll have to let go.
what?
i had a portuguese boyfriend who could read the phone book and melt me.
wrong? why should you think of anything being wrong, have you been doing something you shouldn't. yes? he shakes alex's hair.
sure you can. we gotta nail this guy. you'll be fine.
he... sam lombardo?
so i heard.  congratulations.  it's the most important step in a woman's life, isn't it?
but, max --
this isn't your concern.  it's over, here and now.
ye-ah. was it... it was yours actually, but, uh, i approved it immediately.
sure...
yeah. jeez, give me some credit.
look, i didn't touch it. alright?
i'm teaching my son to be a man.
you believe in our cause?
i'm a greek, thank you.  and i was brought up believing romans were the barbarians.  give our new colleague some of the cretan white.  relax, tell me everything, i'm your friend.
what do you want me to say?
yes, so we were informed.  however, we must of course transmit the remains to you in a receptacle.
how about straightening up the living room?
and when he got serious?
...okay...
aw, i got a brother down in k.c., runs a freight outlet.  i can go halfsies with 'em!  it ain't too exciting, but it's mostly legal.
seven o'clock then.
i guess it was your grandfather, was it ... he called me to check in, said you were on your way and for you to call when you get in. nice man... farmer i hear.
son, let's watch the tape.
yes —— and i must say i've done very well with it -- perhaps even better than jacqueline.
it wasn't fast enough.
wow, she's beautiful. you really think she looks like me?
drink up, young man. it'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant.
come on, tell me.
yeah, first and second.
i don't know, rose. i don't know where i've been, and i don't know where i'm going.  you should have your eyes opened for you, my friend.
well...
thanks, dewey. but with my luck they'd cast tori spelling.
oh no, i want to hear everything. you made twenty pictures in all --
no, that would be much too overpowering.
i understand.
makes your breath like garbage.
tell me about her again.
specialty store down in sacramento.
good. i'll be there to hear his worthless neck snap.
i thought it was -- nobody ever said, "i should have spent more time at the office."
but this isn't the jungle!  this is new york.  how did it get here?  a thing like that crossed two continents.  it makes no sense!
uh-huh. and it's all yours for the remarkably low price of only $200! and if you act now, i might even throw in some free lawn furniture.
salt lake city, utah. transfer effective immediately.
i don't want you to think that i'm that way to you -- i'm not gonna call you a slut or something --
why are you...don't stop...why?
bet they're worth about a million dollars.
you're watching t.v. and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist.
... or the one.
exactly my thinking. except, none of the targets can actually be linked to government, political or special interest concerns. they seem to be just unrelated industrial companies. some insured, some not. 
i didn't think you smoked bud that much.
nobody can do anything right but you!
sorry, miss. it's gone.  ellie's face clouds. the crowds surge about her. she looks around thoughtfully. suddenly her eyes open in surprise at something she sees, and the view then moves over to peter, who sits on his suitcase, looking toward ellie.
the army gave you that?
how do we do that?
she'll not be back. i reckon i'd be safe in promisin' you that.
he had it hidden in the dresser! well, at least it was in there. he took it out, went to the phone and called somebody long distance. -- his wife's jewelry was in the handbag. and something about it worried him. he was asking somebody advice over the phone.
she needed it.
ohio is cold ground. picked over, ten months ago. our people worked it, so did the locals.
i hear you.
evie has a little something for you.
out blood oughta be fizzin' like a warm, shook- up coke.
oh?
we're going to review all the evidence carefully before making any statement...
yes.
then what do you want to stay with me for?
i'm a giant semi-conductor, and there's alien creatures all around us. form the eighth dimension, i think.  look...
at present the girls only peck me. their cruelty surely will wreck me. but one little beak in my own, and i'll up to heaven be flown! at present the girls only peck me. but one little beak in my own, and i'll up to heaven be flown. up to heaven be flown! up to heaven be flown!
i don't know.
buddha is the symbol of luck and good fortune.
across the board, sir.
stupid dog.  i don't get it.
no! not enough!  in times like these, when everything is uncertain, every conservative person should have a substantial part of his fortune within arm's reach.
it don't take no nerve to do somep'n when there ain't nothin' else you can do. 
i don't know.
no.
i promise i won't laugh. who told her?
--no.
terrific.
i don't gamble.
i see, would you like us to inform her of your situation?
no.
yep.  i might have missed some stuff. i'm so used to some things being here that i don't even notice them.
you'd think now, with only six weeks before they ship me back home, it would be easier. but it isn't.
aren't you being rather arbitrary?
shhh. now listen, here's what we're gonna do...
oh, it did. it had a great deal to do with you.
...somewhere in the autonomic relay circuits...
i am from spain.  and i would like a moment of your time.
definitely old.
they're moving pretty fast.
you want me to wait for you, you'll be back --
kyle...
she don't look jewish.
why?
if you go, i go.
what?
why didn't i think of that?
i envy you guys. taking a chance like that.
they're finished, they can't help us anymore!  they've done their duty, general greene, now you do yours!
what?
stay down town tonight.  maybe we'll take in a show, etc.
yeah, maybe, a little.
she doesn't want me around
nope. damned thing wriggled out of my hands. that's all.
just a cold. the doctor says it's nothing serious.
i know.  h-how much do you need?
get off!
don't know what you're talking about.
oh, i know he does.
tomorrow... tomorrow, i'll get it by tomorrow. i will.
you never looked better in your life. as soon as our clothes are cleaned, they're going to give them back to us, lovey.
don't know that either.
it sounds impossible --
i tried to investigate the attack. there are no records. the case was closed and now they've 'misplaced' the file. david's lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before i did. the goodman boy is already in the ground so he's no good to us. so i went to the pub in east proctor where i was convinced of two things.
so if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
despite the lack of challenge.
"humoresque"? i'll bet you don't even know how it goes.
they're...  perfect.  thank you.
what chip?
yes. i'm cutting a record.
boy, we sure do have a lot of filthy small-minded people around here.  wait a minute, i'll get my diaphragm and be right with you.
it's high time you realized, honey babe, that a woman doesn't have to give the best years of her life to radcliffe or smith in order to speak the english language.
it's happened before.  i'm shocked by how little i'm feeling. i can't understand it.  i'll probably have a complete depressoid collapse soon, won't i?
yes, sir, as a final note, i'd like to say, fuck our orders, fuck ramelle, fuck the cheese capital of france and while we're at it, fuck private james ryan.
how do you know he's our man?
sir?
1995?
miss scott panicked?
okay. thanks a lot. here i go.
ah, negative drop.
those are the words of a broken spirit.  my spirit is whole.  i have trusted d'artagnan with my deepest secrets, and i will never believe he is my enemy.
what?
nothing. no mountains. no castles. looked like a giant parking lot. it wasn't even called hell.
oh no!  did he get hurt?
if you talk to tom, he'll assign you to something.
goddamn venza assaulted a taxi driver in the bronx, thirteen months ago.  it's coming to court and the judge let him walk because of the pending case law.
that's jolly.
later, david! later! there's not a minute to lose!
sure.
well, i'm not expecting anyone either.
vodka?
i read your white paper. it's sort of like the bible for what they're trying to do in computer crime.
nicole...
words, words, words!  sally has been tutoring george in the philosophies, isn't that right?
we don't have to help anybody.
yes!!!
one thing i'm not completely clear on--when you gave out the money to liddy, how did that work?
'sokay, 'sokay. i killed it.
will you call me tomorrow?
i could think of better places to meet her, instead of here.  he lives on the whole top floor.
yes.
but, as you are so fond of observing, doctor, i'm not human.
that's impossible.  if it's that big, why hasn't anybody seen it? huh?  tell me that.  it's like not seeing the goodyear blimp in a swimming pool.
i never knew it was so dangerous to hide in a woman's room when she's alone. 
to arm-twisting.
fuck you.
yes. i was able to decode the old texts and give terrence the specifications. it took a lot of trial and error, but finally he got it: adenine di-methyloxide. adm. i call it adam. but just before he was attacked, he hid it...
why?!
you must have been really sick.
not too bad.
the question now is whether or not your brother still owns anything, mrs de moraes.
good-bye.  so nice to see you...
leave? that's exactly what i came here to ask you to do. leave! i don't mean this hotel and i don't mean paris... i mean france. there's a plane for moscow at five-forty.
we get fifty percent. and we get clear of the king.
well, this is a temperate zone.
but that was the fourth straight time.
then you'd better fix your bayonet, because there aren't any bullets in the gun.
i've lost my taste for knickknacks--
all over.  chicago, houston, detroit.  just lately dallas.
and you think i don't want those things?  you think i don't stay up half the night wondering if i've made the right choice living half a world away from you, wondering if any of this is worth what i'm giving up for it everyday?  let's get married.
no, the children sleep with me.
the sidekicks' union! me, tonto, and robin the boy wonder. you top bananas better <u>watch your</u> <u>ass</u>!
yes and so do i, but there are too few of us here to carry it. too - heavy
i suppose guinness will suffice.
he didn't offer you money.
you advise us!
well, jay. they've been exceptionally supportive.
me too.
oh -- uh -- girlfriend.
that's a lie. he's been in the insane asylum ever since he lost his business. and if you ask me, that's where you belong.
... like the other night, when i closed up by myself. that was different ...
something mi trabajo.
great bloke.  really turned things around there.  180 degrees.
you know sophia.  she's so damned judgemental.  and she's so damned... perfect.  and so fucking... serene.  just fucking don't tell her.  because you know mac thinks she's god.  and i can feel him comparing.
a flare?
roach breeding?  sounds better and better.  dana?  the boys are going down under the sewers tonight to look for slime.  egon thinks there might even be some kind of big roach-breeding surge.  should we forget about dinner and go with them instead?
actually, yes.  it's by no means bad, i...
i'm german-irish.
martin.
oh, yeah. for real, point-five.
i spent a fortune on this.
john.  will you please just look for him around the hospital?  i'm gonna go right to the house.  will you help me, john?  please!
telling you what?
why should you?
-- small.
dignity?  who the hell are you to talk about dignity?
ah, dammit!
that's nice, stan.
"...you look around, you say, 'this one has so-and-so, and i have nothing..."
scar's band was headin' north...to winter in at fort wingate...eatin' agency beef. that's what this buck said...maybe he lied.
i told you i didn't want you seeing her.
don't say that -- i know it is --
'cause harlin used to own it.
i'd like to, but i told dr. venkman i'd babysit.  do you want to babysit with me?
i'll keep in contact. you have the bridge.
ira - instant retirement account.
no! i'm not gonna do it! if i don't dress like this for mom i'm sure as hell not going to do it for you!
it'll work....
every one of these songs will remind you of me in a slightly different way...
no, we have nothing to hide.
yes.
i'm... dying.
you expect me to tell the truth about my life to the most indiscreet man in england?
what, what?
how would you like a spanking?
you already did.
he's all right.  isn't that enough?
-- i don't know, i feel like you always pushin' up on me, gettin' close and i love you baby, in every way you can love a bitch, 'cept that one.
james.  it wouldn’t really be...
yeah. i haven't seen him in a while. he used to come to the ranch over summers, but then he started having friends and was going off to college, so... good boy. hal. lives in new york near his mom.
no you won't. but it's okay. you have stuff you gotta do.
enough to get to jersey. i'll walk the rest of the way. i've been sitting a long time.  nice meeting you. it's been a trip.
how many murders did you cover up? one? five? maybe an even ten.
bobby--
are you ill?
like i'm outside in the rain
i have.
want to swim home?
whenever you ask me something why do you always say "let me ask you something?" why don't you just ask me?
i need il duce.
that's all, miss bennett.
it's okay, i got lots more.
if he self-destructed.
i went to see prof. roth!  you know, i had another one of those dreams last night.  i saw tommi!
i was an indian, actually. man, that damn psycho paint...! if that's supposed to be mild, i don't want to know about medium.  the planet earth. it's good to be back.
i'm sorry - i didn't think
stand back.
i don't know. i haven't decided yet.
the gunshot holds no fear.
let's lock off this room.
i know. i know.
they think i'm insane. tell them i'm not, indy. please -- help me ...
why not?
he stayed a long time.
all i'm saying... you don't know how high up the food chain this thing goes.  i've heard stuff.
you don't know habits, you think this is ugly.
what is it?
shut the fuck--!
no kiddin', without a key, it'll take us a month to crack this thing,
in hope of what? learning that it's true?! that we are nothing more than digestives for the creation of a new race of alien lifeforms?!
okay.
that goo. that stuff that tastes like soap.
well, there's a lot riding on this project.
did you do those drawings, doctor?
right funny, hain't it, how they rowed all the way up river in a ten- foot john-boat!
i lost twenty bucks.
please, paul, 'til first light.
you're lying.
it isn't fair!
oh no?
i thought you were a businessman.
what's wrong.
what's the matter?
there's this whispering campaign against me ever since gates won at saratoga.
well, if that's the case, you're sure of winning the first couple of hands--but what about after that?
looks down at the ground in front of her.
closer than you think.
what's going on, claire?
oh they don't?
he didn't get to be under secretary of the air force by being neighborly.
huey, man who's gonna straighten out the brothers if they get on my ass?
good god, you're really-
i shall return.
rae!
i couldn't if i tried.
yes?
okay, walter. 
sure, auggie. i follow. when you don't know nothing, it's like paradise. i know what that is. it's after you're dead and you go up to heaven and sit with the angels.
i'll bet you're a real yo yo.
i helped you buy it. it came with two pairs of pants. it's for luck, johnny. when you propose marriage to a woman, you should kneel down.
umm- i don't think you're supposed to wear white jeans after 1983.
helluva night, isn't it?
we've never sent this much with one courier.
the thought i'm tryin' to get over is you grew up beauteeful. remember me?
oh, really?  one-hundred billion dollars.  ok, make it happen. anything else?
nope. if you're a criminal you don't carry id, and if you do you're a damn fool.
i didn't choose him as my deputy, mr. president.  you did.
school? i never thought of school! if i went to school i could blend in with everybody else, couldn't i?
i know she's not with them. i know something else. what's bothering you isn't her.
really?
i don't rate that at all.
if he's gonna fuck me up the ass!
to oz!
twenty minutes.
yes.
just fine, doc... in fact, i think i might've put on a couple of pounds since i got here.
thanks for the message.
you might want to put a jacket on him, it's getting cold.
jeffrey. are they important things? well forget me - you have to tell him. jeffrey. i mean it.
so you know krylov!
... you have a little... uh... something on your face...
but so much is the same. on a biological level he is... and i will not accept the idea that there is nothing i can do. i have a responsibility to try to make a human connection with him.
can it work?
five bucks an hour. that's the going rate, isn't it?  it's a quarter past two now. my wife's picking me up at five-thirty, so that'll give you about three hours. if you can't finish today, you can do the rest tomorrow.
yes indeed.  fuck! they're erasing you, clem!
i mean, we've had ups and downs, right -- good times, bad times?
all right, look, if he took a break, it would just give everybody some time to maneuver. that's all i'm saying. it's all that i'm saying.
my companion treated me with great civility, and asked me a thousand questions about england, which i answered as best i might.  but this best, i am bound to say, was bad enough.  i knew nothing about england, and i invented a thousand stories which i told him; described the king and the ministers to him, said the british ambassador in berlin was my uncle, and promised my acquaintance a letter of recommendation to him.
let's get back to work, and maybe we <u>will</u> be, soon.
which one?
i mean, the other day you made an allusion to my wife and the possible sexual problems we might be having. i know that to be the case, but the way in which you broached it, if that's your idea of teaching me something...
what about your attitude...where's your job...eh?  you talk and talk and i go to work...what do you do?
you call your son little chief?
yes how are you, janet?  are you happy?
perhaps i have, captain. perhaps i have.
i sell them at the recycling center. gives me a little for gas and food.
i don't think i could hurt one of them with a sledgehammer.
where? do you ask miles where he got that note from? where do you take your words from?  everywhere.
maybe you should. think about it. those who can afford our goods do their thing without upsetting anyone. those who can’t do it to kids from the streets or their own family and it makes upsetting headlines.
pretty scary, huh?
the thing about kids is, they're so... young!  they don't know nothin' yet.  when you're a kid, you think you're gonna grow up an' be a "wonderful person" instead of an asshole, like everybody else.
come on, claudette. a man's not made of stone.
they're taking mine.  when i said they didn't have a future i didn't mean tomorrow.  auschwitz.
uh huh.
well, if your mother turns against you, you have to look for someone to adopt you.
i love you.
part of being a new yorker.
yes, for your hair.
because they're all the same. it's always some stupid killer stalking some big breasted girl -- who can't act -- who always runs up the stairs when she should be going out the front door. they're ridiculous.
what kind of interrogation... su- supposing i said yes?  i-i-i am disenchanted.  i am in love with someone else.
i'm the only person you've told? that's a great line. does that make other girls swoon? do they actually eat up this bullshit?
mai-tai's.  i got this to tell ya, about mai-tai's.
de-la-croix.
why not?
a million bucks. in the last six months.
office of--senator smith?
that's right. you got it! sure! he came in here and i made him change his mind. "bulletin editor saves john doe's life." why, it's perfect. i'll have ned write it up.  oh, ned!
justin?
i didn't say i remembered killing him. i just repeated some words to get myself back in there.
during wartime the national suicide rate goes down.
father, i have betrayed my family. i betrayed my men.  and i betrayed you.
oh, i'm not blaming you.  i just know me. i'd be jealous. jealous of . . . of all humanity.  some rival, huh?
you're right.  i don't give a damn about her.  but to fuck a man's wife behind his back?  that just makes a fool out of him.  i don't like being made a fool of.
oh...
see you tomorrow, maybe.
one more shot?
i do not state it, sir. the prisoner does.
ben. are you okay?
-- it's called a projector.
but what you believe makes no difference to us whatsoever doctor. but it does make all the difference to agnes.
you were going to can me, right?
you talked to gozer?
some other time jimmy, i'm beat.
it's not a rumor. it's a sale.  if tisch can unload cbs for $81 a share to westinghouse and then is suddenly threatened with a multibillion-dollar lawsuit from brown & williamson, that could screw up the sale, could it not?
but i love you.
did you know he was going to be there last night?
what do you mean?
you've been to bed with somebody else, haven't you?
dear god.... how did i come to this?
what’s that? a word?
bang up stuff.
yes sir.
can i steal you for a minute?
shall i?
okay. 
what about him?
not a chance!
i thought so.
you seem pleased by the prospect.
you turned up a one way street!
relax. take a breath and just say it. it’s no big deal. i promise.
death, death.  how about the first thursday in march, ten o'clock.
but of course! please make yourself comfortable. perhaps you would enjoy some fresh caviar, or une petite glace, or --?
on screen.
you know, every day for three years i asked myself that same question?
she didn't want any help.
if you won't do it for me, do it for your cousin, nadine, right? the girl in the pink sweater.
you're so easy.
there must be some way to get it up there.
it's a long story, bo.  i'll explain later.  here, catch this!
yes, and for that you're charged with aiding and abetting.  but we'll let santino handle that.
yeah, watch where you walk dukes.
is it funny that i'm in love with you?
there are no others.
0h, shit!
...we need the shooting permit for main street...
thank you.  where is mr. smith?
touchy, touchy!
you're a reed, man.  i gotta get anna.  hang in there...
ya know, entry level!
stern.
edie, edie, i...
yes.
that's hard to believe.
he was working a.r.v.n. patrols and had one a them little cocky gook asshole lieutenants -- anyhow, the lieutenant took his new playboy one day, sat on the end of the dock, and wouldn't give it back.
when you call me gabriel, i know i've got trouble.
it frightens me.
"the blood tide".
okay.
what hospital?
stop this!
isn't that brad and janet majors sitting down front?  what an ideal couple.
come again?
aw, you've been reading a lot of cheap tabloids. anne and myself are going to move downtown in a nice little flat, we're gonna forget all about this social stuff, and we're gonna be known as mr. and mrs. stew smith. how do you like that?
and some sandwiches --
not these people!  they are ruthless!
no, no consiglere.  not this time. no more meetings, no more discussions, no more sollozzo tricks.  give them one message: i want sollozzo.  if not, it's all out war.  we go to the mattresses and we put all the button men out on the street.
we've got it...
what are they?
maybe. maybe not.
do you still go to church?
mommy, where are you?
it's not your cup of tea, mama.
oh, why didn't you say.  for two-hundred i got a nice rubber band and a real sharp nail in back... i'll gift wrap it for you.  the deal is fifteen hundred. cash.  take it or leave it.
i'm not sure i care to find out what it is.
you tell me.
...one moment, mr. concannon...
yeah.
forget it, forget it, it's mine, it's mine!
partners, ain't we?
exactly how is fourteen days almost three weeks?
i've come here to arrest you for murder.
i'll come to the wedding.
not all.  some choose to stay at home and dream their dreams.  some never make it this far.
it's to follow my instincts. and my instincts say get the fuck out of dodge.
--cotter's--
... and there's no truth that 10% of that money will go into your swiss bank account?
--and it is in my power to confer a very signal honor upon you. in my official capacity, therefore, i--
no bela, that's "incorporates."  look, just say "this casket has..."
ohmygod.  didn't she say anything? she must've said something.
anywhere?
not tonight, louis. no more rest.
please --
that is unfortunate.
you could be quiet.
well, this *is* an orphanage.
evening news?
i didn't do anything...god saved her...
he lures us to capture.
fake it.
so, it's obvious, huh?
as your teacher mr. spock is fond of saying: i like to think there always are possibilities.
well, we need that ring.
you want this in black chips.
i'm - still in training at the academy.
but...
you sure you can manage?
tell us about it...
no, no.  i'm full. too much fin and hump, you know, gives me gas.  Œscuse me.
what for?
raise the glass and push the blue button.
i didn't.
good for you. go find out.
very much so.  we are all, save my friend here.
slip it in ...
one meets so many attorneys in my business.  no, i don't believe i know dean andrews.
for ringo.
you have it?
why is that funny?
marooned on ceti alpha v. he's completely mad, admiral. he blames you for the death of his wife...
stay away from the garden district. serious crime. i don't know what kind of place you're looking for, but there are a lot of studio-type apartments available elsewhere.
all right.  i'll write you an introduction.  take it to wudan. wait there for news from me.
oh, blah, blah, blah.  the guy's insane.
a bit heavy on the powder, isn't she, jimmy?
i can't stand to see you like that. i know you can't help it.
some americans?
i'm sorry, stanley.
what's she like?
oh.
sure you can!  you may even like it... it's a killer rush.  you'll see.  hey, don't i show you things, johnny u?
me?
he can wait. kendall's out of surgery.
i don't...yes.  okay, the board.
he's clear of the horse, ned. better get him.
think about mom.
no one of consequence.
what did you say?
nell, it makes sense.  it all makes sense.  you and i, we were scaring each other, working each other up.
she says my whole body's a mistake.
i'm cooking' up. there is a silence.
didn't even buy me a drink.
do you have a romantic bone in your body?
i know what he said.
but how do you know?  maybe he just wanted to see us?  and now he's gone again.  and you've all killed my father for the second time.
jesus, is it five years? i gotta quit right now.
what are you taking?
why would she lie about it?
the ferret?
yes, i know. cause the dooley sisters weren't in yet.
i think she wants me to come over to put me into the right position to check out her delicates, what ever that means.
i'm not very good at it.
it seems almost inconceivable that i haven't seen her backstage, but with so many people loitering around... well, well. so eve is not working for max after all-  - max you sly puss.
it's not what you think.
are you with me buddy?
craig stole maxine from me, dr. lester.
i remember. supper getting cold, cos you two are out there heads under hoods ...
that makes five days in a row that mr. hunsecker's cut you out of his column.
yeah.
it's not family.  it's business.
else.
i dunno, but i don't think we need him. dump him at the lights.
just stay down.
i have no idea who you are.
bad manners.
if you hadn't used profanity --
i can't talk to you right now, leave me alone...
i've been carrying you our whole fuckin' lives.
yeah, well, it's just us and a few hundred of our closest friends.
whatever it is, it's dark.
can i go in?
you're gonna be sorry if you don't shut the fuck up.
if we're going to identify the source of the mutation, we need to isolate your recombinant dna so we can activate positional genomes.
catch ya' later.
like i said, open container, p.i., misdemeanor possession.  easy to make it disappear.  for you, poof, it's gone.
scarred for life, that's how i am!
hey now, outside of a very friendly dog this morning, it's been a slow decade.  i don't make love every ten years, i get a little cranky.
why?
i want you to forget the company you work for for thirty seconds, and tell me if you really think that sammy is faking his condition.
you weren't. you actually, for some reason, you have the effect on me of making me feel just a tiny bit ashamed of myself.
is this the wish of the masses?
what?
where would you go to sell a chip?
got a phone in that van?
you're too easily impressed with yourself. i believe i've made that point before.
who? donnie and marie?
who?
come on, man. if this shit was all over.
that inspires confidence, that does.
what?
okay.
what are they doing?
i'm sorry, i can't possibly take them paul. i'm overrun with refugees. as soon as we can stabilize the situation we'll take them.
you called us, doctor, if you don't want to look at them here, how about downtown.  i'll drive you down...
-- and she was positively glowing at the awards.  i should be going, she'll be here soon --
the nerve.
i know. i read it. these desecration's in the church…you think they have anything to do with witchcraft?
it's the best collection i've ever seen.
i could.
i don't know how i can get you out of it this time. how will it end? what will happen to you?
you know what? go ahead and shoot me. go ahead! fucking shoot me! come on! come on, man! come on!
that's right, major.
mr. caiman, i've been doing extra research for you after hours and weekends for nearly a year. and i've never asked for anything but this job is really important to me. i'm too old to be an assistant anymore. i need to know this job is going someplace.
i guess so.
now, that's really stupid.
no.  but i'll have a sofa brought out to you.  good enough?
you wanted to tussle, we tussled.
... what?...
--fuckin' a right--
give me a readout, dejesus.
well, then i'm quitting.
you should see the other bitch. what time you got?
good kids.
scams, con games.  how many?
father said witches live there.
what is her illness?
if you have to work...
then you won't forgive me?
plus some guys whose food i don't like.
what the hell's a freeway?
just show me the way.
uh-huh.
perhaps you can explain it to him.  it's agent mackelway.
well,... i'm a singer by trade... summer stock...nightclub revues... that kind of thing...it used to be what i absolutely lived for...god...i can do gypsy backwards - every part- but, one night...in the middle of singing "funny..... - it suddenly hit me... ...what does all of this really mean?  that, and the fact that all my friends are dead...god, i sound like a veteran. dad would be so proud.
maybe it'll be at the end of the data when the message recycles.
i just wanted to check that you were okay?
i said shut up!  now who sent you?
wait a minute, joe.  lets talk this over.  why couldn't we do it?  last year, when we played in that gypsy tearoom, we wore gold earrings.  and you remember when you booked us with that hawaiian band?  grass skirts!
i didn't mean to!
shall i tell you something -- i believed what was called love came after the union -- and i was surprised when my husband, making me a woman, made me know it only by pain, unaccompanied by any pleasure. i saw that my imaginings had stood me in better stead.  and so we became only friends, seldom sleeping together and arousing no curiosity in each other, yet on good terms for a while, as whenever he wanted me, i was at his service, but since the offering was not seasoned with love, he found it tasteless, and seldom demanded it.
i wish i were like you. look at my staff, they won't work, they listen to no one.
i heard already.
yes, please.
yeah, cougar?
that is doctor otternschlag -- you know him?
of course it is. do you know what the sun is? why it's just one huge nuclear bomb. a bomb with enough radiation to incinerate an average man like . . .  that.
you mean the rabbit?  they got him cold.
i think i'll have a coffee.
waiter!
it's an experiment.
yes, i understand that.
i'm a sales rep.  i came here to call on a customer and they gave me a hard time because i'm a girl.
she's up in heaven now.  she didn't hear.  she is experiencing nothing but pure happiness.  there's nothing nicer than that.  chow!  harold ryan wants chow!
it won't work on you.
aye-firmative.
i can't, how can i, in all decency? we've had a good run, haven't we?
what?
he had an orange hat on.
a rather free translation but nonetheless correct. greetings to you too, my little one.  tell me, what do you see?
oh, sorry.
i'll be back on my feet.  soon enough.
fancy it?
they just wanted to say hello.
yeah.
i do like you.
worse than your kraft holiday dip?
it seems fine.
a nigger!
i don't know.
they think you did it.
i think he's running for town crier next year.
you have, yes.
the play? all right, i guess...
ah well. eh, look!
i think it's what you think.
what are you listening to?
i can't he'p it, ma. it don't make *me* giggly an' happy.
yea, but i'm going to dress it up. put the money in a shopping bag and hand it to someone i meet here.
"met his death"?  how could you, his friend, have assumed that? why did you leave him on genesis! spock trusted you -- and you denied him his future!
skull was intact, no soft tissue left--not much to go on.
who says i can't? you're a newspaper man.
if i could have anything... this would almost do.
i need someone with your kind of background.
not one i should like to rely on. francis is still smarting under the terms he had to accept after austerlitz, and he is under great pressure to recover his losses.
right. and they'll be vulnerable for at least two seconds.  data,lock onto that plasma coil.
what do you want me to say?
look, lester... are you unhappy with me about something?
you were unfaithful, it sounds like your confessing.
it's pretty hard to stay away from that word isn't is?
nothing.
what kind of junior p.i. would i be if i didn't go with you?
i don't want them to love me.
hi, lady.
no.  well, i don't know.  well, maybe.  later.
oh, mom's okay. they're just givin' her a ride back. she almost blew outta the back of loretta's pick-up on the way over.
look, i may work for the nuclear regulatory commission but accidents and spills are not my field.
jesus. do you have proof?
shit, shit, shit what time is it.  hello.  i'll be downstairs in ten minutes.
let me do something for myself for a change!
it's not gross. how else do you think girls learn? here turn around and face me.
thanks. 
so that's it? you guys just patch me up and send me on my way?
yeah right.  i got an idea for something new.  how 'bout you guys actually locate your dicks, remove the shrink wrap, and fuckin' use 'em.
it's on the account of the shells. that's my hobby.
yeah.  i practically forgot.  but after you busted that thing, i got to thinking, "jesus--maybe i'll start the violin again." that didn't just belong to woodly.  that belonged to everybody.  maybe he would have sold it to me, and i could have some fun.  after you busted the violin, boy, and penelope walked out, i thought to myself, "jesus--who could blame her?"
not simple, no.
if you like.
ten days ago.
sure, rocky, bob's good for it...
that was my father-in-law, who has a wrong idea in his head. listen, johnny, there's a question i want to ask you. and i want you to tell me the truth if you can. why do men chase women?
they said you were drunk.  why don't you tell her the truth?
yeah.
well, well, well.
it's not trick to make an awful lot of money if all you want is to make a lot of money.  thatcher!
she's counting on it.  she's concerned for your safety, but she wants me to try and find another convent that will take you. or a carnival.
if that's how you feel --
i'll be fine.
we'll adopt some.
because the day after the shooting you sent in a pair of spats - they had blood on them.
i don't know. he ought to...
banister was running his camp north of lake pontchartrain.  ferrie handled a lot of the training.  there was a shooting range and a lot of tropical terrain like in cuba.  a few americans got trained, too.  nazi types. mercenaries.  but ferrie was the craziest.
you bringing your new friend?
it does?  what?
piter.
guess i've told you about my condition.
oh, jesus h. christ!
wait a minute.
major arnold believes he has a moral duty, too.
i told him.
and then what?  half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! you know that!
that's okay. i've already had lunch.
can i sit on the stairways now?
you can't remember that -- !
that's my job.  see you at tea time...
shut up!  both of you right now!
we've got nothing to say.
i heard your ma went ape at the security store today. you look like the prisoner of zenda or something. how long's it been since you slept?
i've never met anyone like you in my life.
do you know about the clitoris?
that's something a man could do...?
i heard enough.
what's going on ?
oh god veronica, my afterlife is s-o-o boring. if i have to sing "kumbaya" one more time...
yes.
that you didn't die?  like the other children?
it was the other guy who busted me.
i don't know.
i didn't want to do this. but i had to or they would've called me a girl.
you knew. you just didn't care.
what guy?  whose apartment is this, anyway?
breathe deeply.
i've always looked forward to it. all right, let's get him out of here and tidy up.
... you know, chauncey... i want us to be...  i want us... you and i to become... close... i want us to become very close, you know...?
better get me another sam's.  join me in a jaeger shot?
why are you yelling?
no problem.  we'll just sell another baseball card.
yeah... only the room service is lousy.  come on, let me show you the tennis courts.
yes.
your "sixth sense"- i've always wondered where it came from.  and what about soran?
i still don't either, even after all these years.
... but i'm starting to think i was... i was going to...
i'm sorry captain. don't take it too hard.
you missed my point; you are no longer an owner.
naturally.
no, it's fine.  i'm fine.
bump?
talks all day, too!  how the hell can you put up with her, john?
and if that is your so-called "flask," how would i have it unless i was, in fact, a thief?
what?
hi... where are my shoes?
no?  what do i act like?
when you were his student? did he come on to you?
wait.  something's wrong.  i don't...
no.
that's for you to find out.
it's your girlfriend, big guy, open up.
actually, someone did. i just didn't think i could eat anything.
-- worried?
i am dubious, but i don't welsh. meet me at the stuck pig. seven o'clock. you're late, i walk. so help me, if i find out you cheated.
some people do it for the fashion
we'll be here.
karen, it's a pleasure. how you doing?
he would have won more but he blew it at the end.  didn't know what cash and carry was.
what do you want?
his wife's influence.
do you wanna go to the van?
he's probably a gigolo.
you really think so?
whatever it is -- it could save you.
ta-ra.
you must get a lot of overdoses. i bet you picked me up a couple of times.
don't hurry back.
she may try to kill you.
or anywhere where people might see us.
yes. i did.
i don't even tell them about anything i'm close on anymore...
see, now why would you do that to a man in my posi-...
i would never marry anybody i didn't love.
yeah, bring it on!
henslowe, you pound of tripe, in my business i would be out of business if i had your courage, so don't tell me about business
yes.
willa harper there is certain plain facts of life that adds up just like two plus two makes four and one of them is this: no woman is good enough to raise growin' youngsters alone! the lord meant that job for two!
i was walking by when i heard a shout.  your men came right after.
who?
the official term is "psychotic".
yes.
you are as radiant as ever, violet.
jesus christ. how've you been? what's happening in your life?
hmmm?
i, uh, don't really know any.  we - -
no, just some crazy fucker. cut half his ear off.
nobody move!
because i'm in trouble.
we'll do that tomorrow, okay?  it's lockdown time.
there was this monster.  he was after me.  he wanted to kill me.
it’s part of some plan. she dresses it up like a terrorist attack.  the explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium.
these are worth at least, i don't know --
yeah –– yeah –– hurry up. zuzu's sick.
with enough exposure, the same thing they do to everything else.
kettleman, barnes and mcgrath. i'm a legal secretary.
i see that.
raising money is tough.
i wanna kill my boss.
so we understand each other?
i think so.
i know.
air bubbles!... doctor --
okay... sure...  it's just that, with my old partner, you know...
who do i have to fuck to get off this planet?
why do i always have to answer the phone?
we nev-- we don't name names!  we say the pope.
are the coordinates set?
the doctors said to do everything the same as long as possible.  i didn't want anyone being -- weird around me.
i want to dictate my will.  i need a notary?
they're closing the granview. you know, theater down on biscayne?

i will be returning to vulcan within the hour... i wanted to take my leave of you.
that's what's used to redeem the mileage, so in noticing the pudding, each cup had an individual bar code -- in other words: two dollars and fifty cents for ten cups of pudding is 500 miles. add in the coupon: it's one thousand. you see?
well, don't just sit there, shoot him.
you left your back wide open.  freeze could have killed you.
okay, okay. you say it's the real thing? that's cool.
funky little house, ain't it?  friends, your hostess is now going to retire for what's left of the night. if you need me, i'll be in the bedroom upstairs -- but try and fight that need: the door'll be locked, i'll be trying to sleep, and if anyone so much as breathes in the keyhole, i'm gonna empty this thing into their fucking head. thank you all for the bestest birthday a girl could have.
yeah, paul, are you gonna get home okay?
i was hopin since we spoke that you might have remembered something that would give us an idea where she is?
which parts?
isn't zerzura supposed to be protected by spirits who take on the shape of sandstorms?
what the hell are <u>you</u> so down about?
if that's true, then you must know my mother's maiden name. what is it?
let's get a couple drinks, okay?  hey, take a look behind us. do you think that car is followin' us?
really?
i did.  that stuff i gave him was counterfeit.  they'll pinch him the first place he tries to spend it.
you don't understand sweety, daddy doesn't pay, daddy sees the show for free. but you do get points for being horny on a night like this.
cassius, didn't i tell you to stay out of your brother's mind?
mr. lundegaard, that very well may be. i must inform you, however, that absent the receipt of those numbers by tomorrow afternoon, i will have to refer this matter to our legal department.
beautiful.
i don't know. she's living with that "entertainer"...
no, no, you're right, fry. what's to be afraid of? my life is a steamin' pile of meaningless toadshit anyhow. so i say mush on! canyon's only couple hundred meters, after that we're in skiff city! so why don't you just butch up, stuff a cork in that kid, and get --
i can always get a fresh one. karen - you're a gibson girl...
paris opals.  twelve-and-a-half cents.  i sat down with a pencil and added it one day.  but i figure, if you're gonna be sticking something in your mouth, you might as well make it the best.  ah, here's a lost soul.
i didn't know the answer --
i did too!
...i know i am. let's just do what we gotta do here, and get the fuck gone.
my parents were killed in an auto accident ten years ago.  alfred has been supporting me ever since.
will you paint the damn thing. why do you gotta be such a baby.
gimme some room here, will you?  back off.  gimme some space.
mr. fennyman, let me explain about the theatre business.  the natural condition is one of insurmountable obstacles on the road to imminent disaster. believe me, to be close by the plague is a bagatelle in the ups and downs of owning a theatre.
security.
and i know sometimes people like you have to pay a price for their greatness, and that price is loneliness.
well... was it a prescription?
looks like you'd make a good runner.
i'm not -- hold on...
i don't know...
and maybe that's why he ended up dead in the streets of rome.
simple engineering, though, wouldn't you think?  change the machines around, whatever you do, you could make other things, couldn't you?
this.
a god damn radiator hose in a sixty- four-and-a-half mustang.  you know how long it took me to find that hose?
if we don't get that pint, he's in trouble.
they fought against the indians?
he's dead, you know.
all right... elevate me!
--you should get back into bed.
karl, i know you want him, but the police are probably on their way. maybe we can convince them it was all a mistake, but not if they hear gunshots! if you lock him in he'll be neutralized -- now do it!  karl?  karl!
i don't, huh?
it was on a sunday, wasn't it?
no. [beat] you put me on drugs and then you put me in the jacket.
yes.  the ghost.
humor me, puff. it's essential that i am able to trust you to function independently in the world.
i think she knows what's going to happen . . . she doesn't appear to bear us any grudge!
but you were a qualified pathologist. was this army general a qualified pathologist?
yes you are.
so what are you doing tonight, jack?
what is it?
what do you mean, a part of harry?
seven pounds, eight, i suppose. why?
my pleasure. eric don't smoke these.
watch this.
this may be a very good inn for germany, but it would not pass in old ireland.  corbach is only a league off, let us push on for corbach.
i be.  i'm living large.
my lucky charm.
yes, sir. the day he sets off everyone is supposed to raise the flag of "free india." then he walks some two hundred and forty miles to the sea and makes salt.
[your brother wants to talk to you.]
yeah... almost.  you want to come up and watch sportscenter?
in case you've forgotten, we're being paid to be here.  so it might be nice if you conducted yourself with a certain amount of decency.
however i may apprise such testimony from monsieur montcalm, fort william henry is strong and stands.
what am i supposed to do?
what difference can that make...? all right...
i don't know. i'm not sure. he said there are people who want to lose, who are always looking for an excuse to lose.
no, i'mma go on to work.  i don't wanna hear elroy's mouth.  now listen to me, craig.  it's gonna be different living over here.  don't let your uncle and your cousin get you into no shit.  understand?
i just said i didn't feel like raping you.
paternity test results. christ dewey, you're never going to believe who milton's kid is.
you don't have to twist my arm.  say now, that gumbo has quite a kick.
at this stage, you either get form or function. you said she wanted function. i gave you function. what are you complaining about?
so, you're a righty?
long story.
bloke told me.
yes?
i never use mine. but it's a good thing to have. just as a threat.
but i'm not cheap, you know that? loud, but never cheap.
yup! worked right outta depoe bay for just about every season since i was able to haul my own weight.
a load of amphetamine i told him i had.
yeah, that's what we need. more agents.
ya know, ever since i met you, my luck has been for crap.
no -- i told you not to come in this lobby.
that's it isn't it? you married the wrong woman. she leave you? was she bangin' someone else?
all right -- roby and melkonis will go with faust.  hunter and i will make up the second team.
who were they?
a bit rapidly. i don't care what you say about david, he's a perfectly fine teacher!
in order to succeed, you're going to have to go old-school. one night boost. put all your nuts in one basket. and...
i'm partial to oaks, as are all faerie folk.  mayn't i come visit sometime?
does koessler ask about me?
nothing so far.
you're lying...
i'm sorry, i don't recall --
do you ever wish you had done it?
when you make out your will -- and the way you're going, you should -- would you mind leaving your body to the university?
manual overrides aren't working.  i'm getting nothing, lieutenant.
what'd i say?
only one you've never broken.
i've already addressed that question, mr. scott. we'll e able to follow the captain's movements.
do you have visual?
you don't wanna be noticed?
fertilizer, captain, i think we're in a cranberry bog.
are you crazy?  the joint is crawling with cops now.  you wanna go to rikers?  go to the hoosegow?
lucy's going on seventeen now...
i'm not staying at this party so we can go home with someone else's wife. that's not why we're here, right? we're simply being neighbors here, and i think we should do just that --
no. this works better. with you gone and i don't have the money, he can't touch me. but i can sure touch him. after i find him i'll come and join you.
another forty-three people reported taken, sir...
michael!...
the fact is, i have to get going.
yes.
what's it...
you wouldn't?
huh?
marla doesn't need a lover.  she needs a case worker.
yes... my god...
i don't know what you did to that girl in there -- and don't tell me -- but it was bound to happen, the way you carry on. live now, pay later. diner's club!  why don't you grow up, baxter? be a mensch! you know what that means?
why?
he's "discovering" india.
i'm still stewing about that ape laying hands on me. and that fuckin' bartender sticks a weed up my ass, too.
good luck.
oh, but you must, my pumpkin! sex without flirtation is merely rape!
your husband returned at, what, seven o'clock?
nice one.  would you like my phone number?
you know, dana, i'm very very hurt that you didn't call me first.  i'm still into all this stuff, you know.  haven't you ever seen my show?
but i'm the one up there on the screen.
i can't see...
i'm an evolutionary biologist.  what do you do?
and mr. kirkeby tells me that several nights a week you work late at the office -- without overtime.
you want to borrow the car? you don't have a license.
i do, please.
big business. i could work with that faction quite nicely, colonel novogrod.
he... i'm trying to think... nothing, really... he... he said he liked jack oakie pictures.
she's hardly a full hamper herself.
don't you think i know it?
you want to go back in?
cops? you mean they nabbed those cruds?
maybe she had to use the bathroom. she pees, doesn't she?!...
nothing. i mean, nothing. i try not to do anything that will produce garbage, so obviously we're talking about eating and basic stuff like that. did you know that the average person produces three pounds of garbage a day?
incredible similarity.
no.
he's sick?
because i'm his damned pin-up girl! his, all of them!  they know me. they're in prisons with libraries, they collect clippings, i'm their worthy opponent.  you keep my name out of this.
i'm a good boy, but no one listens to what i say.
i don't know.
what kind of medication are you on right now, linda that's --
no, it was irresponsible!
in the desert? what for?
about six and a half million dollars.
yep.
yes, where would you go?
oh my god, by wolves?
shit, i bet i been laid more'n you have.
at least around here it does.
just use the keyboard...
great.
what about?
my pills...
stop -- singing!!!
of course we are.
what kind of dead head gets a temporary tattoo?
johnny, johnny... let your daddy and your uncle and leland talk.  ben... leland, we can play the french against the norwegians. what do the french love more than anything?
it was an earthquake and it was dark.  i have no idea.
tell him the channels, dusty.
do women think it's feminine to be so illogical -- or can't they help it?
absolutely.
that's because we live in the future. which is what's on my mind.
bourbon and milk.
there's still a sex-change --
i'm lookin', i'm lookin'!
discreetly.
i don't want you here, terry.
did the mescaline just kick in? or was that debbie reynolds in a silver afro wig?!
hey, donny --
you got me.
it's just across the park.
i don’t think so.
but lo and behold he found another world that progress could annihilate!
nothing....
yes.
it's possible.
don't even start. i'll be honest, i don't trust you. bur lets pretend for a minute that what you say is true, that i want to leave. what can you do about it?
i don't care what you wanted to tell me.  you're through!  get your things and get out!
tom?
would you do something for me?  i need you to check and see if there's a lump in my breast.  i can't afford to throw money away on a doctor.
what are you talking about?
-- i thought it was time for a routine maintenance check.
for a man in my position --
that's okay, rok.
grandma death.
yeah... explaining my position. some asshole wrote a poem about that once...
the naming of names is not necessary. just concentrate on her face. your shadow will do the rest.
you retired, too?
you don't have a choice.
can you lift the furnace.  i need money.
no, no, i-i-i, uh, i don't use any major hallucinogenics because i took a puff like five years ago at a party and
before or after i have my nervous breakfown?
with id and a gun...? impersonating a federal agent is a felony.
how perfect.
it's the giang hu fighter lifestyle... kill or be killed. exciting, isn't it?
i know what i'm talking about, after all they're my plays...
possessed of an encyclopedic knowledge of the law. a razor sharp litigator, a genuine leader, gifted at bringing out the very best in others. an awesome ability to illuminate the most complex of legal concepts to colleagues, courtrooms, the person on the street.  the kind of person who plays three sets of tennis but doesn't sweat. but underneath the elegant surface, was an adventurous spirit.
beverly hills hairdresser... what kind of a thing is that to do... you might as well be a faggot... think that's funny too?
she says, throw the piano overboard.
where are you from.
what?
i thought you didn't respect money!
yeah, well make sure you lock it on the way out.
we've had nano-tech for the last 30 years.
i can't.
i'm not sure i...get your drift.
the fuck are you talking about --
like me?
uh huh.
for what?
she my foster.
maybe it wasn't her that paid him. maybe the money was for somethin' else.  how the fuck do i know? i'm just an old city cowboy tryin' not to fall outta his saddle.
i'll see if i can, you know, work things out.
she wasn't steering her own course, she was steering <u>yours</u>.
lisa, please!
oh. i mean, except for that.  yep. i'm trading in a car dealer for a heart specialist, so that's pretty good...
you know what he did.  he's doing it again.
i thought it was inspired.
i'll tell you the truth, i heard this guy on a call-in radio show and i might not marry the person i should marry because i've become obsessed with him.
did i ever talk about kirsty?
lori, don't you understand?  i feel i was meant for something more than this.  i want to do something with my life.--i want to be somebody.
well -- other departments are, yes.
cynthia... that would not be a good idea.
i hope she's all right.
the mission director.
good night.
i saw a guy eat a fish eye once in seattle. he was digging through his food with his chopsticks for about five minutes till he found the fish eye and he dropped it into his throat. i guess it must have gotten stuck in his uvula because right away he started to have trouble. his throat began to flutter there like there was a wind blowing. and he couldn't swallow and they rushed to him and loosened his collar and they were asking him if he was alright and he started to turn blue and his eyes started to roll back into his head and he still couldn't get the fish eye out and they tried to do a heimlich maneuver. i went over to him as they were preparing to do an emergency tracheotomy. they were over him with a knife when he suddenly shot the fish eye out of his throat and right onto the ceiling. splat! it just stuck up there and spread out. it was about the size of a half dollar. and that's why i don't ever eat fish eyes.
greenbank?
you would, though.  that's what i'm saying.
no. but you'll get used to it.    welcome to the men in black.
no, actually i was thinking of becoming a brain surgeon.
what do you think?
what do they always say?
i can't help it, it smells so good.
hi dad.
great.  you said you'd ask grierson about putting our guest somewhere else.  did you?
no!
did your collaborator know?
in her walkman.  it's the one thing i knew she'd be taking.
sandy, scan the whole sky.
what's that?
i'm just saying.
some vague promises of a test, that's all - if a particular part should come along, one of those things-
goodbye, mother.
and you're not just saying it because you think we want you to?
what?
...you see, i can watch things up here, doolittle. i love to watch things, just stare at the planets and meteors and asteroids, gas clusters...
well, you should find out. she keeps talking about them...
but let me remind you that this treatment is... experimental.
well, it's almost over.  we've gone to school together for three years, and we've been through a lot.  but with that training out of high school gone, what's going to happen to us?  we all know what the answers are.  we want to be happy, go to college, own a car, maybe raise a family.  but what if that doesn't happen?  i have, i have to be honest though, i have all the hope and ambition in the world.  but when i think about the future, the truth is, i am really...scared.
you don't have to do that.
your house must have been a zoo.
learn anything?
we need it.  sensations are addictive and pain cuts the deepest.  tattoos, piercings, tribal scarring -- because we regenerate, none of it's permanent.  so we have to take it to the next level. to remind us we're alive.
just smile again and be reasonable.  i'll order dinner here--just the two of us--like old times.
we just take it?
yes.
fuck you! fuck all of you! i'm done kickin' it with cows and roosters. -- and drinking moonshine with johnny cash! senior and junior!
what are you asking me for? he's so busy lately i hardly see him. and he's been so preoccupied.
now you're down to three-ten in the case. you must've cooled off quite a bit since you got here.
-- yes, jill.
did you ever report it to anyone?
i'm not afraid of struggle, clifford.
well, what is it, honey?
there's worse places, honey.
jeez, mom, stop trippin'.
now you come back.
well, i -- it's just -- i don't know, a user, i mean... users wrote us. a user even wrote you...
how about cinderella—or a real hot love story?
of wa?
sometimes talking to a stranger is easier....
you can't trust melanie. but you can always trust melanie to be melanie.
that sounds like their problem.
if i'm late, carjack, don't start without me.
i love you.
well, maybe just one. to be polite.
'who's afraid of the big bad wolf, the big bad wolf...'
he could've monitored the calls on a scanner. did you call her from the set?
fine, ratz. thanks.
well, i tried, you got to admit i tried. i thought i might just trap you there, wilhelm, but david here was too quick for me. smart move, david, smart move. no, i don't have the telegram, but i know it exists. and i want you to know, wilhelm, we're going to keep looking for it because i believe you sent it.
i don't know.
why not?
you take tuberculosis.  my smoking doesn't go over at all.
yeah, if i can.
you're always your harshest critic.
you're fired.
the man in jail is always for freedom.
about the baby.
forget it.
oh, harold. 
yes, sir.
step into my office.
i don't know.
it'll hold!
sometimes it can be pretty hard to locate.
that's the idea.
get out.
i counted four.
well!
don't know yet... i have to get in touch with alan. he was going to tell me how to
not the only things missing, nick.
what a horrible death! do you know what you remind me of?
okay honey.
i'm not going to dignify youwith answers.  if you'll excuse me, i've got a jack vincennes press conference to prepare for.
we can go together.
james...do you remember...six years ago...you had a phone number!  you tried to call and...
are you coming or not?
hal has it.
well, we have to do something about this -- "stuntwoman".
walk, walk, walk. what'd you say?
you've gone off to america, on your <u>vacation</u>...
good night.
yah, it's this vehicle i asked you about yesterday. i was just wondering -
sure.  twinkie?
you're a cheap, crooked grafter - and your concern for your children and your mother -
you miss?  well, you don't leave much when you miss, do you, fat man?
i don't know. he's a hairdresser.
look, asshole, i'm right! somebody's a fuckin' rat. how many times do i hafta say it before it sinks in your skull?
the broad has disappeared...
right here.
ok, i'm going to play you just a few seconds of this tape -- i'd like you to name the song, the lead singer and the three hit singles subsequently recorded by him with another band.
you're not rotting meat.
he had the club out on the old trail road--
cocky.
i can't tonight.
if you knew why, you might know where to look for him. i don't envy you this; he's not done -- he's going to do them faster and faster to keep the adrenaline rush.  now, i've done what you asked me.
what?
did you really write a letter to me? or was that a lie, too?
no, that's okay.  all i need's a little nap.
what!
i'm against it.
well, if it isn't the groom himself! you're just in time, king.
then that's not much incentive for me to fight fair, is it?
you're quite a girl.
i like to see her happy.
it's a job.  i keep banker's hours.  i set dinner on the dining room sideboard at six.  you can serve yourselves.  breakfast is ready at nine.  i don't wait on people.  i don't stay after dinner.  not after it begins to get dark.  i leave before dark comes.  we live in town.  nine miles.  so there won't be anyone around if you need help.  we couldn't even hear you, in the night.
frida, listen to yourself. if i said i was a werewolf, would you believe me?
'cause scooby does have a quality that i've been looking for, a quality that is emblematic of american today. it's part disillusionment, part hope...
joe, you do get around.
he'll be transferred to a military hospital as soon as he's stabilized--
look, big head, i'll be at your car.
you don't have a piece of the action?
my <u>wife's having a baby</u>...
did you ever fuck my wife?
years ago, something horrible happened in this town. when i was still in high school. a girl named elizabeth sherman was attacked by four drunken seniors.
clam it!
do you know what he's saying?
as brave as my father. as wise.
well, it's up to you. seven six five. how will you be paying?
you could check. it'd be in his files.
if the french army had been commanded at jena and auerstadt by a tailor, the king of prussia would certainly have gained the day.
do you have life support?
you call this archaeology?
moved out.
i'll give him five more minutes then i'm calling the cops. i don't need this, man. i'm not even supposed to be here today.
what do you want here?
that tends to happen when you're the boss's daughter.
did you - kill him?
anyway, it's hard to live gay, that's the right way to say it, in a small town like this. i've wanted to leave many times, but my love for linda and frank and another certain person that we won't go into have kept me from it. anyway, i'm rambling. if you're going to live in the wheatly garage you need to know that it won't be easy. doyle is a monster. not just a closed minded redneck, but a monster. a dangerous person. i've told linda that one day that man is going to really hurt her or that boy. maybe even kill one of them. i see it in his eyes. i'm very in tune, maybe even psychic. doyle will make your life hell. you're a perfect target. when i first saw you i was afraid of you. not really afraid, i guess, just taken aback. but also, i felt a real sensitive feeling from you. and for some reason, frank has adopted you. much like a stray animal. i'm sorry, i didn't mean it like that. in a good way. anyway, i just want you to know what you're in for. i have a good feeling about you. you're good for frank. maybe it's that he can have an adult friend on a child's level. i'm sorry, i didn't mean it in a bad way.  there's one more thing. it's none of my business why you were in the state hospital. everyone has something in their past, maybe you tried suicide, maybe you did something -- terrible. but what i see before me is a gentle, simple man. all i want you to promise me is that you're capable of being around linda and frank. you know. you would never hurt them under any circumstances, would you?
knots!
yes.  why not just say a building if he meant any general type of structure?
let me me help you, then. you picked up the phone and made a call -  'hello, adolf? wilhelm speaking. listen, old pal, there's a jew-boy musician i want you to help. he needs a permit to get to paris.'
alright miss, calm down.  i just need this lane open.  i need you to pull your vehicle onto the shoulder!
i'm completely stunned. i don't want this to happen.
jeez, what do you think? to see it!
this "... of what i call god and fools can nature." who wrote that?
you oughta lay off him -- he is the p-p-president, after all.
what i want is to help my father.
right.  no one.  i mean, i'll tell myself sometimes but... don't worry -- i won't believe it.
later?
i was in new hampshire.  i was at the old location.
i saw the taped outtakes of the interview with the girl.  i know you 'acted' your reaction after the interview.
we can hope.  you still have your job, right?
well, let's go.
well, i'm not on drugs.  but i might be crazy.
and then?
please!    it's so wonderful to be appreciated for my mind!
good for you. now why don't you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want. you didn't go through all this for my benefit.
here. i'll do it.
he certainly could. about a month.
well he's handsome and he's charming.  he's all right.  for now.  don't say it, i know, i'm rotten.  i can't help it.  i've tried to be good but it's too boring.
not interested.
i was angry.
oh, i know. she's so sweet, she's been so good to me...
and the check is...
shut up!  you're scaring me.  stop!  you're scaring me.
maybe he melted.
sure he knew her. her boy halle, too.
this is our crow's nest. i'm showing it to you now, but you'll never see it again.
well --
huh?
i ain't lettin' go ktil you tell me what's up. i'm reaching' a point where i'd kill someone for the nicotine on their fingernails.
the scimitar will serve my needs.
tremoille... don't.  please...
i don't like the noise.  just practice.  practice makes perfect.
there's nothing to know, ann.
she's so damn... english.
i don't want to hurt you, catwoman. yet.  after tomorrow, you can do anything you want, but please, just stay out of sight for the next 24 hours. i won't stand by and watch my leader get all emotional over an animal like you. i warn you, don't tempt captain god when he is angry. let is complete our mission in peace.
peace - the dignity of man - the destiny of the human spirit!  show me a man who says you win <u>those</u> by fighting wars, and <u>i'll</u> show you an idiot!
well of course i'm sure. i'd tell you. christ, i don't even smoke grass.
what of it?
you've made us look pretty good in the past week.  and the way you handled the press --
well, fed or hungry, pulleine wants them in position immediately. .
actually, it's funny you... i'm actually, uh, between...
i don't suppose....
i'm just saying she wasn't scared.
it wasn't me before, james.  it's become me now because of...what's happening.  please untie me.
so everything he told me yesterday was a lie. everything.
don't say "we" when you mean "you."
yeah, i know bill, i came up with the plan remember?  just have those hangar doors open and ready, i can take it from there.
oh. right.
i roust some muchacho on the street, doesn't have his papers, all he got to say is "yo trabajo para jimmy herrera."
you used to work at copper penny?
can you beam him off?
uh-huh.
really?
you're not going anywhere...  sam...
what time are you gonna pick me up?
you took me to the house.
i need to get my goddamn head examined.  you can't rule something out on a whim. or because she's cute. i've been following your whims all across the u.s. of a. and now i'm tired! me!
i think a nurse named kalarjian is going to choke isabella to death!
oh, she does, huh? isn't that sweet of her! you don't , i suppose.
what do you mean?
well, yeah.  now.  that's not good.  <u>okay</u>:  <u>okay</u>.  we'll set up the war room <u>here</u>...
the story about him and miss alexander, mrs. kane.

i know a man who needs a refill.

naw. that's over with.
there's a god damn good reason.
don't call me father.
i had you sent away.
i couldn't go to sleep, mom. i had to tell you!
yes.
my heart weeps.
am i?
aren't they gonna wonder were you've been?
i'd hardly call our yardman a friend.
oh, no sir-ee.  if yo don't have a reservation you can skip to ma-loo.
no, i guess i'm just saying that shit happens and somebody has to deal with it.
i don't know what you mean, sir.
i have been in love with you for so long.
my life was totally crappy, herb, and she... fixed it. she made me happy. which i'd never been. she loves me the way i am - <u>right now</u>. <i></i> i don't want everything to change. i don't want her saying yes to some big success. i just want her saying yes to me.
is he going to be okay?
kablooey.
how do you think i got to be a colonel?
i don't know.  i guess i like your stories.
why?
protomatter. an unstable substance which every ethical scientist in the galaxy has denounced as dangerously unpredictable.
that hoist, with the winch...

i like it here.  last time i saw you was greece. you had a good spot.
please don't follow me.  don't do it!
no, i wasn't, actually.
she knows you real self?
sometimes he whistles.
exactly!
o'higgins... mohawk o'higgins.
thank you.  will you bury geoffrey?  i know he's dead.
stay here? is that necessary?
can't.  need water.
dr. venkman, we believe that the purpose of science is to serve mankind.  you, however, seem to regard science as some kind of "dodge" or "hustle."  your theories are the worst kind of popular tripe, your methods are sloppy and your conclusions are highly questionable.  you're a poor scientist, dr. venkman, and you have no place in this department or in this university.
i was hoping for a kind word, little sister.
ye...
trust, responsibility, taking the weight, for your choices and feel- ings and spending the rest of your life living up to them.  and above all, not hurting the object of your love.
that is correct. i was engaged to render an opinion.
yes...
unbelievable!  trent told me he wrote it.  he's history.

ten pounds. i lose it and put it back on.
being gale weathers.  what the hell are you doing?
with gestures, of course.
jaime? where are you?
carnies.

god, it's ugly!
gordon said you were good. the tailored dress is our code for drugs. did you notice what was pinned to it?
not right now.
oh, all that work.
aw, hon, you're better'n them.
-- go blind.  i know.
yes - mr. kane.
stop that, fran.
and, o my brothers, would you believe your faithful friend and long suffering narrator pushed out his red yahzik a mile and a half to lick the grahzny, vonny boots. the horrible killing sickness had wooshed up and turned the like joy of battle into a feeling i was going to snuff it. minister rises.
it wasn't a trick. i used to be an electrical engineer.
never heard of the place.
no, and we got four of 'em.
i know.
i thought you were my mother.
the girls like it loud.
in back of the garage.
i'll go and make up his room!
in the briefcase?
we're supposed to have gold-trimmed padded seats, now they're telling me that there was a mistake and we can't have padded.
what? who?
i trust you... besides, i don't know if i'm up for the amish today. you can't curse or spit or anything around them.
shhh!
wonder. beauty. joy.  love.
oh yeah?--my personality put this thing over--
an expired community college student id card.  what did you used to study, raymond k. hessel?
oh? anything else?
edie, down here it's every man for himself. it's keepin' alive! it's standin' in with the right people so you can keep a little loose change jinglin' in your pocket.
exactly what i said. i'd trust him before i'd trust you. how much clearer can i be?
all the more reason to eliminate him.
well, maybe i will have a sandwich.  do you mind waiting a few minutes?
yes -- i do understand.
give it up, ray.  you're living in the past. ghostbusters doesn't exist anymore.  in a year these kids won't even remember who we are.
no, but i can tell you he's not gonna be too happy about this.
you're alfred beidermeyer aren't you?
good. zero and julien will go in through the window and disable the motion detector. the rest of us will come in through the front door.
well, i know they've been going on for years, and they haven't gotten any place.
professor of medieval literature. novelist. weekend flautist.
tom kazansky.
lovely.
you expect me to spend the rest of the war sitting at home staring at a ring? and you'll meet some french girl who can speak your own language. no thank you!
not where i come from.
er,... good.
it's...it's a long story.  can we meet somewhere?
joe.  joe.  she's written sixty-five songs.  they're all about you.  they're all about pain.
your first sexual experience.
sorry. look, you sue me, your husband dies, you drop the lawsuit like a hot potato, and all of it quicker than wind from a duck's ass. excuse me. then you ask me to lie to the police.
no i just....i don't want to, i just want to be connected to talk to a girl.
you're out of your element!  this chinaman is not the issue, dude.
is that your diagnosis?
really?
to make it easier for them or you?
if i let you have your own way, you little rascal, will you respect me?
nah, that wasn't in the contract.
what the devil do you mean?  you have your lodgings, a certain stipend -- i thought i had arranged everything for you --
i need your help.  in order to fight blackheart, i must wear the armor of achilles.  i --
most of them.
he may have already rejected my humanity, but you also have a twin
police.  we'd like to ask you a few questions.
people say that?
on it!
that's what koessler wants us to believe. to discredit low.
you're so full of shit.
everything... i don't have children.
all right, i'm with you.  i just hope we know what the hell we're doing.
you're not having lunch?
your classmates?
it won't happen again.
edward is taking me to some fancy place for dinner.  the rex.  ever been there?
oh, you can come off it with us. you don't have to do the old adenoidal glottal stop and carry on for our benefit.
johnnie, please. nope. charlotte, north carolina. here on business.
i know, that was some crazy shit. i never in a million years would have believed it if i hadn't seen it.
i told you -- with my mother.
--into the <u>black</u> <u>hills</u> with--200- something miles from here--
for what?
long.  you just got off the train and stayed without knowing anyone there?
i stopped drinking.  i gave up drugs.  and i'm meditating three hours a day.  it's the center of my life...
i don't know, they just did.
i am always on time.
thank you.
it's different 'cause you keep your own apartment.  because you know it's there, we don't have to go to it, we don't have to deal with it, but it's like a-a-a free-floating life raft... that we know that we're not married.
you know i do.
don't worry about coming up with anything. it's cool.
but they will. as sure as night follows day. they have to. i want you to find her out. tell her i was thinking of her.
...and i want to talk to you about your <u>promotion</u>..
they had sabra and shattila.
my daughter isn't here to carry out assignments like that for *anybody*.
you find something, georgie?
i probably do.  but for the time being, i'm willing to forget about it...
it's kind of falling apart.
i'm late for the dedication.  then i go after freeze and ivy.  alone.
alright, i'll make the call...
is that old crab still with you? mary, you said you were putting her up for a month -- it's been a year and a half.
oh my god ...  oh my god ...
you know it?
there's a shark in the area. don't move from where you are!
remember that stupid hippie art teacher who failed me sophomore year? i didn't think that just because you get an "f" that means you have to take the class over again.
does she blame it on me?  the baby?
yeah, man. where is your beer?
you never lose a gift like that.  you just forget how to use it.  how about it?  will you try?
you don't have to say anything
can't what?
come on greg. you're the only one who knows her. the truth will save you.
gee, you think so?
it's not so much a matter of a place as of time.
you must take me for a real idiot.
look, you want cheese, go someplace else.
ooh, well excuse me.
too perfect. too beautiful, too talented, too sophisticated, too everything -- but what i want.
who knows...  we have to get used to living around here.  maybe good help is hard to find.
it's okay to be wrong, just don't be dead wrong.
what were you talking about...?
i know, i'm sorry... i-i've been really busy...
i'm here.
jeanne, no...
very good, sir.
it went to the goddamn fbi and they didn't find a goddamn thing.  it comes back a week later and one guy in the dallas police department suddenly finds a palm print which for all i know he could've taken off oswald at the morgue.  there's no chain of evidence, bill.  and what about the tow guns actually seen in the depository?  one an enfield photographed by a newsman and the other a mauser, described by deputy weitzman... maybe, just maybe, lee oswald was exactly what he said he was bill - "a patsy".  take it at face value.  lou, susie, i'm going with my gut here.  he's got an alias of hidell to buy the rifle, "o.h. lee" to rent the room, right?  what's in a name, right?  in intelligence, they're assumed to be fake.  a name is sort of like a postbox number, a code - several different people can use the same name, right?  then why can't somebody be using oswald's name?
they're not my children.
that's a little vague, spock -
eeyuu.
no, major, i merely wish to state that your vehicle appears to be somewhat slower and heavier than mine, and point out that, if you would be kind enough to pull over to one side of the road, i could pass you and be on my way.
good!
which one?
specialty product.
eighty-four years old! i'll be gummin' pab-you-lum!
i have to throw up...
nothin'.
he just wanted a few minutes before --
yeah, but that's not the whole story. she got remarried.
they were lying. there were no witnesses, no escaped lunatic. the whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there.
and she got the medium.
floyd say he don't be eatin' pussy.
if we could send a distress signal...
hi, mrs. boatwright...  i'm sorry 'bout the way i acted the other day, miss boatwright.
joanna, what the hell is--
uh, why, why are you doing this?
suppose she should leave it?
oh yeah.  when is it?  this thing in queens.
i wish you'd listen to us. what about the meeting tomorrow? we need to frisk people.
i think you just blew "don't ask, don't tell" out of the fucking water.
drop it.
it looks like it.  smell those fumes?
why not?
his names horrace. horrace, this is ricky slade.
i don't.
i won't try to keep up with you. i'm not as fast on my feet as i once was.
tell me again.
he's a vegas entertainer.  i used to do impressions of him.  we sorta... got in a fight over that.
and outpost? you're happy there?
why?  are you german?
i'm not knocking it.  it's a great solution.  not only the storage but you can see everything you have.
there's no need. i learned the craft from my 						grandmother.
what do you mean?
thank you.  i can't imagine how mrs. kane came to make such a silly mistake.  the sedative dr. wagner gave her is in a somewhat larger bottle -  i suppose the strain of preparing for her trip has excited and confused her.
yeah, i know, you know...kids.  you want to have one of those?
carl??? carl did this?!!
from their heads...
i lost my job...
yes... i'm here.  and no.  i don't know the name.
clyde fitch, thought you may not think so, was well before my time!
where's my head? where's your fuckin' balls? huh? you know i'm tryin' to put somethin' really big together out here. you know what i'm talkin' about, huh? you know!  if you're actin' like this now, how can i depend on you?  there's a lot of things gonna change out here. and if you wanna be there with me, sammy, you're gonna have to go my fuckin' way.
which is neutral, no doubt.
nah, this'll be fine.
do you want the truth, anya?
what does a man usually tell a girl?
leave your phone on the hook.
<u>excuse me</u>?
we must examine you.
that is what bothers me.
why, that would mean... i really don't know what the outside universe is like at all, for certain.
is it...
count on me; that's my specialty.
all right.
with your permission...
do you remember the day i came to your monastery, when i was a baby? and you comforted me?
how could i forget?  you make quite a first impression.  sharon, could you please bring us some coffee?  i've heard over the years you're quite a first-rate pilot, dave. legend has it you can get in and out of any field, no matter how small...  i'm a bit of a pilot myself, you know.  flew grasshoppers for the field artillery in the war.
yeah, morgan. i got fired.
i'm gonna help you.
well, use your head, "stalker betty."
well, i've been away for a bit, travelling, that sort of thing, and now i'm trying to write a novel.
... "the beast."  a nineteen-year-old kid.  she understands the nature of "the beast."  she called it a wild animal.
we are to meet mr. rutagunda.
his body was found on january 1, 1993, but do you know if that was long after he had died?
oh, how fortunate i am to have lowell bergman's moral tutelage to point me down the shining path. to show me the way.
i think that's what i'm saying.
the digital conveyer?  you mean i'm going to get diced into cubes and sorted up there in a thousand pieces?
what else you got?
sure you could, in wildwood, new jersey. if you sold this,  you could have a pretty nice penthouse on fifth. but you wouldn't have much left over for decoration.
you solved the box. we came. now you must come with us. taste our pleasures.
let him go.
that's right.
100% pinot noir. single vineyard. they don't even make it anymore.
what's the first?
cold.
i was thinking the poconos, charlie. maybe vegas.
do you ever regret it? the divorce, i mean.
how can i?  your last three pictures tanked.  the board is giving me hell.  no bankable star will work with you after this.  if you just compromised... a little.
you mean when i'm not running the country?
you shouldn't have pushed us!
you jes' watch us!
then why don’t you reach him?
the freighter started through at 1:42.  the sea water seeped into carl's watch and stopped it. at 1:47.
you're telling me you want out? already? you're telling me you don't want the money? hugo is going off. he smells. the flat smells. we can't wait any longer.
some of the smartest robberies have taken place aboard ships--
eddie, this is quite a scene.
making the key to the throne.
that's one of the plagues, right? the grasshopper plague!
don't crank the gain any more. you're gonna fry yourself.
colon cancer.
you were saying how you couldn't initiate change yourself, so i figured i'd help you out.
really? thanks.
i think we need to eat.
this is 132, over.
it would destroy such life in favor of its new matrix --
i did tell you, didn't i?  that i'd be ready to start the berlin model today?
what happened?
don't worry. she's good with kids.
he'd die pretty quick, either a heart storm or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain.
but i don't have that any more...  ... all that's left for me now is the room upstairs.
dr. jones, we are all vulnerable to vicious rumors. i seem to remember that in honduras you were accused of being a grave robber rather than a scientist.
i've got what i want.  turn around baby, look at me.  look at your man.
a friend wrote me.
then?
casper! was up kid?
it won't work.
it's over becuase...for all the the right reasons i hope, what i said.
forget it, sonny.  they're gone.
one more night --
i promise i'll take good care of these people, they deserve it, they're dead, all they've got left is their looks.
you like strong women. i've done my homework. or do i need skin-tight vinyl and a whip?
but where do the rats come in?
what sort of car?
something happened, something...
fast.
hello, darling.  good evening, mr. carpenter.
miles?
let us assume, as common sense dictates, that the prisoner's story is false. but if he does not come from another planet, then surely he sprang from our own. yes, sprang.  as an animal psychologist, i have found no physiological defect to explain why humans are mute.
rasputin!
a madman.
that right.
mazel tov!
you sure it belongs to his wife?
it's the paymaster from moscow -- with our gold.
but you can't tell us what she wanted to talk about.
hey, two hearts got busted last time. maybe she's not over it either.
oh yes, major, i have recordings of all his symphonies. i kept them safe during the bombing. my favourite is the seventh symphony.
the real joke is we never went fishing, but we're still fishing.
i know it as surely as you're sitting here, sweetheart.  she was the most vital woman i ever met.
let her in, what's the difference? let her in.  no, actually, no, i'd like it very much if you would ask her to come back later.
[beat] you be good to yourself, jackie.
they think over a hundred thousand. they're just estimates.  but we held strong.
in other words i never understood until today how much pain and anxiety you've been causing with your reviews. steven, it's so unfair.
i don't know if i can do it alone.
looks like, unless tokyo lets me start.
what?
you feel you know me.
i don't suppose it's an airline, is it?
well, one of the girls got careless and two days ago she gave birth to an eight-pound american-japanese male.
well, i mean... i don't know you... this has never... i've never won anything and... i don't have a vcr.
"...and behold he will come that walks as a man, yet is not a man- ..."
"my president"...
no.
fuck you! fuck you!
in and out.
well, yes, she's happy. of course dave doesn't have her life force, not at all. there isn't much furniture in his house, just a table and one or two chairs, whereas rose has furniture coming out of the windows.
come on, rob.  my relationship with laura has obviously disturbed you a great deal.
man, what're you saying?
why couldn't you just look at his feet?
the wire is ten years outa date.
who said that?
yeah. sure.
you're sure nobody's following us?
oh. well. i...
a thousand.
i like.
nicer than most.
i'm stuck here for another couple of hours.
that way we do not waste avgas or our motherfucking time.
i think anything you want to do, you'll do well.
i served in his majesty's army in the french and indian war.
good. nice to see you, bruce. johnny.
then if you are japanese, then why are you called the chink?
what do you expect? i'm your attorney. you owe me five bucks. i want it now.
who else?
they're here, they're fine. in the dressing room.  see you later --
trying, sir!
make it out to cash!
-look. you want to kill a good guy, but not be a bad guy, you wait until a bad guy kills the good guy, and then you come in and kill the bad guy, and then you're the good guy.
real mccoy.
i can't, i have no idea how he's doing it.  and that leaves you trailing, jim.  you gotta get your act together.
the ottos always waited for the bus with bear.  they were the only parents who did that, together like that.  i guess they're what you might call hippies.
i'm sure everyone's doing their best.
[you stole the drop.]
sure, they're safer.  you always know what they're going to do. trouble is, it gets a little dull.
except for small eyes.
north. it's north
kay, i told you...
you're not my father!
you're in a hurry.
go ahead, ray.
how a girl get like that?
just the same.
not too fast.
don't you have a maid?
california, huh?
dad.  what are you doing here?
i thought he was with you.
you're the fuckin' animal! you ran around with every guy i knew while i was breakin' my ass for you.
right.
the chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal.
i'll say whatever i want --
my parents know i'm out.  they know i'm here.
stand by. bird dog?
well, it can't be any worse than my life here.
just like that --
a wise policy. but if you did, i can assure you, the sight of royalty would cause you to dismiss all thoughts of bloodshed and stand... in awe.  whereas, a president... i mean, why not shoot a president?
we should never have come! i pay you good money, only to have my life endangered. you'll be hearing from my lawyer!
that's like a stag film.
thank you.
baby? and what baby is that?
this is a highly irregular procedure! this is absolutely unprecedented!
please! 
but if it wasn't for dignan i probably would of died.
yes?
nothing... i promise-nothing...
go ahead.
i'm not.
i am a blank sheet.
i'm just not ready.
for what?
and i'd like you to call me ann.
i wish you didn't have to go so early.
then why don't you take the job that louie netz offered you at boeing?
how well do you know chigurh.
my daddy is going to be a hero? like power rangers?
people tell me that i am crazy.  that my business will never work in your country.  what do you think, george?
no, it's the great and powerful oz. now listen--you're in over your head. this is how it's gonna work. i review the tapes, i find your story.
there's nobody holding you here, mr. doe.  it's only natural that people—
got ya.  is it okay if i do the sleep thing?
dehydration.  vitamin deficiency. protein deficiency.  any or all of the above.
yeah--
oh shit.
and i don't care what you call it! i'm not putting her away!
if you call that a kiss.
i'm wery sorry, but --
so whatta you got for me, sport? why are you here?
why are you so hostile? i know you're frustrated with your life right now, but you can choose not to be so hostile.  here.
yeah. thanks.
put david on it. he seems anxious to clear my name.
so was i.
sergeant lucas.  may i come in?
how come every word you say is either "cocksucker," or "shitballs," or "fuck?"
fifteen seconds. perhaps you should consider hiring an attorney.
let's start with some rhythm. sway back and forth like this.
sure.
i've said this before. i think your the one who needs medical help.
just for the day?
what are you doing?
then you should.
shut up!
what makes you think i have any clean shirts at my place?
what? no. this is my mother's house. i don't live with my mother. i just stop by, help out. i'm good like that.
so would i.  but it's not mine to give.
what?
just come down, john. just --
well, that's where the pyramids are and we want real pyramids in the ad.
i'm curious, but i don't want to know. jeez, i hope you haven't been telling people what's going to happen to them.
you look good yourself.
i said, who the hell made the map?
shoot.
i got family. ...please.
that's a laugh. you're all strung out. you're a bowling junkie.
you're walking to california?
yes, well the guests and some of the staff left yesterday, but the last day is always very hectic - everybody wants to be on their way as early as possible.
i beg your pardon --
cougar, you're on the ball.
no! now we're inverted!
you've been working on this, huh?
even so, you're allowed to boast. you look thin by the way, i've mentally undressed you, i can see your ribcage.
yes. mr. buckley thinks you treated him a little rough. he's in the hospital. how about it?
fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. you know this little tid bit, dorothy, and this thing, here,  is a neighbor. what the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, i don't know. goddam!!!  this is the suavest guy i know. look at you. you're one beautiful fucker, ben. i love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. shit, that is too fuckin' much. where's those glasses. this beer's gonna get too warm. i can't stand fuckin' warm beer. it makes me puke.
oh, just a routine mammogram. she said to say hello. she's going to positano with your brother's family.
well, you know what they say. human see, human do.
hm.
harcourt was the brain who brought it all together.
show you right on a map.
no, not really.  it's...it's in my mind.  like you said.
hey, i brought some friends. and some beer.
i'm afraid i've only got a few minutes, but i'd love to.
see you, bob.
her name is pamela isley.  i saw her talking to gordon.  she must have stolen his keys, altered the signal-
well, it still says some animal got laid down here after, don't it?
that kid's name was jim marshall.
what?  who the hell are you?
now, hildy --
i'm making a mess.
the rain... sometimes it gives me the blues.
okay, i won't.
haha.  right.  it's no problem.  i love making tapes.
not a bad business. this thing would still be growing, too. the first printing order on misery's child was the most ever--over a million.
you have fed. you were made for this...
no.  she stopped by to pick up some papers.
you've already made a start. doesn't look that clean, though.
who else could have used that key?
i'm glad you stayed.  thank you.
his head.  someone cut it off.
you won't see paulie anymore.  he's sick for good this winter.
yeah? see ya.
i'm sorry she never got her miracle.
hiya, ralph...
doesn't matter.  i like change. you know, constant turnover.  as soon as i close the deal, it's one of two more times, then adios.
you will run into the hotel and hide behind the u.n.
you should say so.
might as well go all the way.
oh shit
he's plastered.
oh, thank you. i think we shall be great friends, don't you?
for the show. it's halloween eve and time for our show.
tryin' to get a buzz on. but i'm too buff. too much muscle mass.
i wish they'd skip the formality of this annual review and just cut our budget. our silence on the matter should be enough to appease the civic conscience without wasting an hour we don't have.
that can't be!  everything has an antithesis!  why not this?
johnny.
nobody thinks that.
that's all you got to say? "yes".
are you nuts!  it's too risky!
he's busy right now.
what happened to kurtzweil?
exactly, i mean, after all, we're men!
look at upham, you don't hear him complaining.
i changed my room at the hotel.
captain, if --
he must be a good friend.
i don't know. just a minute...
do you live in a house back in wherever.
we need to head for the coast.
hey, you want something to eat ?
what?
glad to see you. ester'll be glad, too.
yes.
sure, lana, i'd love to.
you at least bring the gun?
..."a boy named sue". i think that's why he's such a bad cat.
copy.
what did they say?
yes...look, during the last five years we were married, i had...i was getting more and more...unhappy, more and more frustrated.  i needed to talk to somebody.  i needed to find out if it was me, if i was going crazy or what.  but every time i turned to ted--my ex-husband, he couldn't handle it.  he became very...i don't know, very threatened.  i mean, when- ever i would bring up anything he would act like it was some kind of personal attack.  anyway, we became more and more separate ...more and more isolated from one another.  finally, i had no other choice, i had to leave. and because of my ex-husband's attitude--his unwillingness to deal with my feelings, i had come to have almost no self- esteem...  at the time i left, i sincerely believed that there was something wrong with me--that my son would be better off without me.  it was only when i got to california and started into therapy i began to realize i wasn't a terrible person.  and that just because i needed some creative and emotional outlet other than my child, that didn't make me unfit to be a mother.
i was born in mine. i don't mind it anymore.
yeah. it smells like snow.
you know it. stay black...
it's really happening.
zerzura, the white city of acacias, the oasis of little birds.  as me about the scent of acacia - it's in this room.  i can smell it.  the taste of tea so black it falls into your mouth.  i can taste it. i'm chewing the mint.  is there sand in my eyes?  are you cleaning sand from my ears?
that's been noted.  but where does it lead us?  unless you have something more to add.
like freddy.
will you please get back in your wagon?  and stay there?
the kind we've been talking about. can you answer me now?
i'm sure.
i don't know... gotta be at least four to one.
i feel as if i'm walking under water.
not for long. not when they do a fingerprint check.
mr. dickson?
it's a fucking stately home, of course there'll be something there.
forget it!
that's where the mask comes in.
i've tried to tell you, emily. the president's going to be all right.  he had a comfortable night. there's no danger of any kind.
fire, mr. scott!
everybody likes to, don't they?
i --
twombley.
i'll go into town with you.
a sign that the builders knew time travel through a black hole was possible.
i'm glad, john. goodnight.
stuck, who? what guy? huh?
are you sure?
yeah, like maybe never.
...position...
i am done with theatre. the playhouse is for dreamers. look where the dream has brought us.
you felt pleasure.
that's easily arranged. but first, back into bed.
why, i'll betcha there must be a million albacore and tuna running of the coast right this minute.
not yellow, cautious.  see, it's very easy for a fighter to accidentally hurt --
hi, how'd your day go?
will do.
you read my thoughts, mr. holland.
that cheap aftershave i send you every christmas, you actually wear it.  i'm touched.  sit down, sit down, what brings you to mombassa?
what?
you can walk away.  we both can.
and what exactly is it that you can't take anymore of?
just don't fall asleep.  sooner or later something's gonna happen.
we must shut down the building.  go wider --!
i'm flattered. twelve hundred points of interest in yosemite and you pick me.
yes.
the style of fighting that tim studied didn't believe in belts.
i'm only a little fool - i'm an amateur at it - you're a professional. you've been shaking your cap and bells all over town.
what journey?
no thanks. i'll take care of it. we've got a lot of shit to talk about.
any time. but you don't have to worry about a thing for a while. marty went down to corpus yesterday.
bruce, i know, but i was in the biggest jam --
i don't owe you anything; you don't owe me anything.  we went to bed -- what was it? -- ten or fifteen times?  it wasn't memorable enough to carry any obligations.
he wasn't out when you were there. he just wasn't answering the door in the dead of night... like some people do. this fellow lives like a hermit...
you'd persist at the cost of your own life? the lives of your crew?
but we strongly suspect something will happen to screw up this splendid organization of yours if you don't get that sky pilot out of our tent.
yes.
if you're trying to get me to say that she was a bad woman and hated me and didn't want me but that's not true, she was a good woman, a saint... 
sit back.
you've decided against the merger?
all right then.
i'm not sure.
what are you doing here?
what?
i hit her.
she lies all the time.  why would i say i fed her if i didn't?
oh, jabez! ...  did you hear, mr. webster? --  now you'll help him, won't you?
night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'.  it's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
where's emily, hank?
you know who i am.
that's fair enough, jabez. man's got a right to mull things over. we'll drive round again, week or so.
twenty-four hours, detective.
hello, dorothy. 
i thought maybe you'd won a radio contest or something. is that single- spaced?
why?
the honor was mine. captain riker.
really.
yeah. what's wrong with you guys? think ahead. we find 'em, sue 'em. we'll make a killing.  we'll have dinner at chasen's twice a week, we'll be pissing on ice the rest of our lives.
no.  i never smile any more.
who?
1530 rivington street.
all 900.
just so you know, i bought you out with maxie. i suggest you leave while you can.
it's the first door on your left!
because we are an odd couple.
you heard me --
no...
ah? oh, well, your birthday's not till tomorrow, honey, i hate to tell yuh.
i'm here! take it easy! take it easy!  sit down, sit down...  did she come?
i didn't want the job.
for you, she is beautiful.  for me, there is only my wife!
... mmm-hmmm.
hey, see any controls back there?  and anyway...we beat the son of a bitch!
locked safe in here. i leave the scene in your safe keeping, ned, i have a sonnet to write.
okay.
we'll just go in for one minute -- it'll be a riot!
no way to start a partnership.
jerry, we're not just going to give you seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
look, fuck the thesis. i think there's a book here. your photographs and my research, together.
tomorrow.
'neutron man'... 'laser man'... i can see why. 'tarantula man'...
backup?
no.
... moving in the wrong direction... away from when i even remembered what it was like to have a man to... anything... hold fucking -- sorry -- hands with, for christ's sake. i was feeling like really bad that dr. bettes is married.  which is probably why i make poor spencer hug me more than he wants to... like the poor kid doesn't have enough problems. he has to make up for his mom not getting any.  oh, boy. who needs these thoughts?
string that bluebeard up to a pole!
okay, you win. i'm pissed off. i'm seriously peeved.
lucien baines?
but, for a time... a passing fancy?
how'd you like a punch in the nose?
we have to go back!
how's your own boy, miz cooper?
where's that?
certainly.
you've got a gun, motherfucker. drop it!
how much gold has the master of the yengeese?
oh, that's mrs. rosson--remember, you met her yesterday?
blow out the candles!
you could sell your beamer.
we leave it where it is. stick to the plan.
thank you, son.
leon could still have hung himself.
no, starling, there isn't time. and you've still got crucial work to do in ohio. we want him for murder, not kidnapping. i'm counting on you to link him to the bimmel girl, before he's indicted.
it's hers, you schmuck.  look, rose, i... i don't know what to say to a woman who tries to jump off the titanic when it's not sinking, and jumps back onto it when it is... we're not dealing with logic here, i know that... but please... think about this a second.
gotta be one of his disciples or something.
well, you know, anybody saying they want to go out with you is... pretty great... isn't it...
it was six in the fucking morning.
she's te reason -- cured me of women once and for all. oh, i got rid of her, buddy, i didn't waste no time kickin' that bitch out. hell, she was screwin' everybody in savannah. i caught her in a motel with this long tall son of a bitch and boy did i beat the everlastin' piss out of him!
in a quandary.
you mean that guy was an agent?
you what?.. what are you talking about?
what the fuck i tell you. you don't hafta shoot nobody. just hold the gun. they'll get the idea.
you fucked up, glen.
we might have to take that chance. cause i feel pretty strongly about this.
klingon justice is a unique point of view, mr. president.
someone should be with you.
in your money, perhaps $65,000.
no--
yes.
damn it, norman!  he's lying.  don't you get it?  there is something seriously fucked up going on here -- and he's causing it.  why can't you believe me?
this scag is enough to keep every junkie from here to the mexican border high as a kite for the next two years.  you think we're gonna let zimmermann haul it onto <u>our</u> streets on the fourth-of-fucking-july!?
you have no right...
no.
how much did they cost?
well -- at the moment, that'd be me.
then explain it to me.
they were green eyes and they were slit like a lizard's.
your father's dead.  don't ever forget who's taking care of you, giving you food, giving you shelter, and giving you the allowance in the first place. if you plan to work at the academy the way you work around here, you won't last very long.  i don't want another word.  finish your dinner, then finish cleaning those 'droids.'
how did i look?
just two things. what do i use to shift the stuff and where in hell am i gonna put it all?
monica.
i was wondering, how are you planning to beat the security?
wayne gretzky.
marylin rexroth. she came into my office and signed a pre-nup with howard doyle.
what do you expect me to do about it?
just get better okay?
oui.
it's about that pimp that was shot a couple of days ago, drexl spivey.
it seems right to us.
an empty tomb?
selfish! but they get a chance at happiness. can't i have that chance?
who's the bigger idiot -- the idiot who gets kidnapped, or the idiot who lets herself get kidnapped by the idiot?
now you're talkin'!
i want to live.
you think that's what mcdermott was raving about in the ambulance?
yes, but i'm afraid --
in edmunds' things.
gimme a dollar.
the other bombers might have more luck. we shouldn't just give up...
i feel like a traitor.
c'mon, valiant, doesn't this whole thing smell a bit funny to you?  i mean, no offense, but how did a mucky-muck like r.k. maroon find you in the first place?
-- yeah, yeah, yeah.  you just have your hundred grand ready.  for that you get the machete...the mask...the whole damn thing.
then, why'd he lead us here.
that's good. that's real good. ben meadows getting pictures for the paper.
a bit sadistic, don't you think, captain...?
you know, i saw him sitting outside your gate...  oh, i'm sorry, i'm forgetting my manners again!  i haven't even introduced myself yet. hi, my name's lindner. karl lindner.
take your time.
who's he play for?
i deserve that.  anyway, i've... i've only just realized
if you wish to put things on that basis, then i will say good day to you, monsieur.
nowhere. you just sit here and... eat.
dude, listen, man. i'm cool. how much for the treatment?
it was exciting.
acquired?
oh, you don't? what else do you have on me? you haven't found any bodies yet, have you?
i don't understand. who's responsible for all this? who is khan?
houseboats don't go anywhere.
no, she wasn't.
he means they're thieving dogs.
what?
yes, she's, she's very warm, but, but it-it's me that wants to be giving to you.  i-i-i want to do things for you.  hannah doesn't need me as much.  i'm being presumptuous.  not that you need me.
i'm fine.  i'd just rather keep it on.
you golf?
his mother's an only child.
i know he's got a paira kings. he don't have to stick 'em in my ear.
they're in order -- it's perfectly clean -- just check with comsec- intel like i said.
pipe down, brain lady!  and you...
no...
well you're telling your teachers and your friends --
my dad acts like he's johnny fucking perfect and he's really johnny fucking rapist.
mom, do you know who that is? blonde hair.
but why? he didn't weight the others.
not yet.
just think of me as the person next door who likes it quiet, and we'll get along fine.
i've seen this mother, de vries.  we can bag it, no problem.
my god.  murdered?  -- what's this have to do with rorschach?
yeah, me too.
thank you, ensign.
about 22 hours on site.
me? nah. i'm more of a people watcher.
yes, actually.
i'm not going to vegas.
well yes i understand that, we don't want them high-tailing it out of here.
you're in on this.
no, mostly his wife's. she's in paris, france, right now. my husband delbert is real friendly with him. delbert's in law. does work for him.
you were married to a woman in chicago?
i've caused you some trouble.
man, you need to look at this with a little compassion. jackie ain't no criminal. she ain't used to this kinda treatment. i mean, gangsters don't give a fuck -- but for the average citizen, coupla nights in county fuck with your mind.
no, i don't have time.
he shall be endured
no, no. nothing like that. i work in a bank.
so!
that's a relief.
joey, relax. you're taking this the wrong way. why don't you sit down and have a drink?
agnes who did you see?
we want to see our casino making money again, mr. bangs. making money for our community.
you use your sleeve.
you mean the boom-boom room?
i'm sorry.
tapert's got nothing to do with this.  he came here to get his palm read.
there's a carriage house around back.
ian's a very good friend of mine.
no, ho-jon, we're not going to open you up.
california. san francisco.
we wear black.
i never fucked rod.
gwen?
what's tomorrow?
could you be a little more specific?
don't bullshit me, laurant!   i know about the van gogh.
zander, please... let's go !
are you sure?
next week, brother minister.
is that right?
no, i got out of the car and i ran to the bridge.
you've got the wrong jones, mister donovan. why don't you try my father?
...i missed two-face by a heartbeat. when we catch him, you gotta let me kill him!
what i've got to do now is pick up tuttle, interrogate him at the same voltage as buttle, to the same meter reading to the last penny, and juggle the books in electrical banking.
i am vada margaret sultenfuss. my mother was...
yes, i did.
you don't like the way things are, i don't like the way things
why so edgy, mr. dean?
yes.
i think i've heard of you.
there won't be ... there won't be ... what else do you need?  how else can we help you?
oh. uh, my stepmom took me to the doctor yesterday and they said i was twelve weeks.
i felt like it.
how's your star?
would you like some coffee, general?
lady viola is pious, my lord.
why am i gonna mention your name?
i know...  we're going to try and get in this way. i don't think you can make it.
as much as possible.
hey, ma. did you bring any clothes? i'm freezing my ass off.
i may have to put the wedding on hold is all.
fine.  i'm fine.
oh god, jeffrey, is that you? oh god.
i can live with "great."
so you drink, and you fight with a cop...?
not right now, i don't mean right now... but eventually...
i'm just afraid i'll hurt peter. i think i love him.
i'm just saying --
excellent.  how long until the assembler tank is complete?
are you absol...
brad wilson.
okay.  fine.  we'll remain here until you get back.
in certain cases, hell is the operative word.
princess?  i know of no princess.
-- who's married to --
okay, jackie, done.  i like the way you do business.  your money is being held by a kid named larry sellers. he lives in north hollywood, on radford, near the in-and-out burger. a real fuckin' brat, but i'm sure your goons'll be able to get it off him, mean he's only fifteen and he's flunking social studies.  so if you'll just write me a check for my ten per cent. . . of half a million. . . fifty grand.
he's just knocked out.  i've been knocked out.
your family just met me.
you shut your face --
we're just closing, friend.
not even close.  what happened?
"parting is such sweet sorrow…"
i know son, i know...
what's that mean?
superstition.
after i graduated college i was all set to go into my father business. umbrella frames -- that's what he made. it was a sensible business, i suppose, but i didn't have the sense to be interested in anything sensible.
what did you do to end up here?
i'll get him. you get the man in, taylor  now. or i'll article 15 both your asses. move!
good - i've got to dash -  say that i said hello to ellen for me would you...
why not?
but you're not going to.  you're not the kind.  you're tired, anyway.  you've been up all night.  you cracked up in a plane.  slept in a ditch.  but you want to know something?  it doesn't show on you at all.
there is no privacy in russia. this whole thing seems very suspicious. what's the real reason? if you ever want to get into russia, take my advice... confess!
she's quite right, dmitri, a man of my stature should not have to
n'about ten minutes.  what was your movie about?
he was the bank on that shipment outta mexico three years ago.
not at all.
i've wondered, diz--maybe this don quixote's got the jump on all of us. i've wondered--maybe it's a curse to go through life wised up like you and me--
you're dealing with a psychopath. he gets out of jail in ten years, or five... or ninety days, and you'll be looking over your shoulder for the rest of your life...
that fella come by... tom.
guess.
what bus?
i thought you were buying my company.
sign of the dead come back to life.
i'll be sending you on a report tonight.
my fucking heart bleeds.
you've never used them before.
then how did a reman get to be praetor? i don't get it.
yes--a camp bill that will never get beyond a first reading. so calm down, chick--and--goodnight.
...hell.
your supervisors have no idea why you're here.
-- katie.
worth pursuing?
norm, that's terrific!
oh, and the sun block?
... the way she moves.
well, then, it don't look good for the huskies...
that's lila?
no.
heather langenkamp?
is it that music?
defuse the bomb.
you think i should just because there's no reason?
do you think people in the new town care what happens over here?  this will always be the ghetto.
i came over to the bed and you smelled so good, like you just woke up, slightly sweaty. and i climbed on the bed with you and you said something like --
i'm in traffic.  there's no place to turn.
10-4, in a few minutes.  he's down checking a buoy in the bay channel.
and try the president's private number at the hospital.  make sure this is on the level. we're busy people here.
you knew about us?
why?
...a patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
yep.
travis, i never ever met anybody like you before.
well blaze your ass out of there! you've completely altered your trajectory, are we linking up or not?!
i must protect my interests, ms. kyle.  and interest number one, is <u>moi</u>.
oh.  well, that would be a ... change.  thank you, mrs. peterson.  you have a very reassuring voice.
what makes you say that?
i love you so much.
jimmy.  everyone calls me jimmy the finn.
honey, they're young.  they're probably newlyweds.
--what?
but...
miss kubelik, i don't think that's such a good idea.
he is already on the plane.  i hope you will treat him with the same respect you have shown me.
then what the hell happened to him?
it'll yank him right off his feet if he's not expecting it.  the line could get tangled in something.
ah, i can smell it on you.
smile, little sister, smile.
sorry.  you don't know how many times i've heard that.  "a lady lawyer?  are you crazy?"  like a woman couldn't be as good a lawyer as a man.  or better, in fact.
relax, man!  no physical harm intended!
yeah, i went down on a few guys...
i'm not your wife.
the best he can since you gave him nothing.
what?
he's three now. course, not in that picture.
that's okay.
i thought everything.
oh shit, what's today?
indy, they glow like fire and get real crazy! then he talk in this real scary voice!
can the maker repair what he makes?
i'll need the big fingerprint kit... and the one-to-one polaroid, the cu- 5, with film packs and batteries.
well, er... no.  i mean, you don't look like dragons i've heard of.
"wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day> it was the nightingale and not the lark that pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear. nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree. believe me, love, it was the nightingale."
i wanted to talk to you about that.
will you buy the sheep for me?
i heard you met shu lien today.
my dad used to be in the army, but now he's just your average hvac specialist. he and my mom got divorced when i was five. she lives on a havasu reservation in arizona...
elliot harmsway is my uncle!
it was released in philadelphia, probably on june 14, 1995.
so how can we tell if she is made of wood?
i'm not interested in your smart ass remarks now, lady. let's go. right now. you and i can discuss it on the walk home.
police corruption. it's everywhere.
even when you were young?
there!
we want the cans the jacobi home movies came in.  they're in the far corner of the room under the windows.
we need to talk.
it's mine...
i want to introduce a couple of people. doc white is a flight surgeon; he has volunteered for gunnery training so that he can go on the mission, because we can't spare the weight of an extra man.
what about crack?  you a user?
why would they care?
affirmative, big duke six -- we're even got some rockets left.
ask them to sit down.
what's the matter with my place?
it was just somebody else. from the crash. he was just....
hold on, coop...
then blame the one who made her...
marsh left her close to three million dollars in his will.  that's motive. she admits to being there the night of his death.  that's opportunity -- and her fingerprints are on the nasal spray bottle.
you mean, am i gonna help you kill them cowboys?
that's going well, then.
only a handful of people are aware of its existence. let's just say it's the ultimate defensive weapon.
goodbye, darling.
yeah. that's right, too.
thank you, father, thank you.  whatever. goodbye, amen.
what are they doing here?
you're prone to violent outbursts, aren't you?
that's not good in prison. it's just not good.
yeah.
will the cruise set it off?
of course not. i'm robin hood. i take from the rich, and give to the needy...
sure, if that's what you want. why not? it's all human nature. so we just have to launch our baby and wait for the decline and fall of civilization as we know it.
well, it's rather interesting about brother, actually. i realized the remarkable thing he had when he was six weeks old. he looked at me and understood me, he knew exactly who i was. i know it sounds crazy but it's true. he's very remarkable, he was born for the ministry and could move millions, but he doesn't know that yet. i have to warn you about him, he can be very dangerous, there is an evil streak in him, a streak of pure sheer meanness. but at heart brother is saintly and that is why he was born for the ministry even if he doesn't know it.
probably.
diane, everybody loves that you showed up.
grace heard it.
do you want them?
shut up!
kurt thought?  what about you?  do you think anymore?
and john, don't make me come look for you.
ah, charley and i are...well, we're thinking about...i mean, actually we're sort of talking about maybe getting back together.
where did you hide it?
well, offer her a seat! you want me to do it?
i don't know, maybe i wasn't clear. but i thought... i told you to keep your mouth shut.
we gonna stay, ain't we?
lucky for you, you got him in both of his... well, what we loosely refer to as... hearts.
she smiled baby.
what broke <u>you</u> free, girl?
the hell are they?!
hey, hey, where you goin'?
tonight you find out what it means to suffer.
showtime.
bad enough. and god knows i don't exactly fit the new corporate profile.
but it didn't fall.  you caught it.
it went real good.
okay, okay. bye.
lds?? are you dyslexic on top of everything else? come on, lemme give you a lift. i have a notorious weakness for hard luck cases -- that's why i work with whales.
10,000 gold crowns.
we're glad you people could make it, and we're anxious to have you try out our new product.  we think it's going to be a big seller.  but you're the people that make it happen.  you're the market share everyone's tearing each other apart to get at.  it's your opinion that's going to make or break us.
i suppose i can, sir; are you planning to take a swim?
but mr. norman said --
i know about esparza.
shh, they'll hear you!
shut up.
i imagine a child would have to commit murder or rob the seventh national bank of tarrytown to be deprived of a birthday party.
yes, the rum is gone.
could be.
i can't do it! i can't do it!
don't i always?
what needs clearing up?
you can't let erik do that.
well then how can you say somebody else was there?
is it a joke to seek the truth about this man?
getting outside the shield is easy. after that it's up to you to get us off the surface before we freeze. can you?
if that's being a softie -- there are two of us.
but horror stories!  why all the time horror stories?
i don't know.
if she don't want you, she don't get anything.
at least i improved myself. what's up?
the chief?  or maybe even turrentine?  your c.o.?
no, it actually hadn't. toiletries were missing. a suit was gone. so was some luggage. that's it.
you first, edvard.
who's defensive?  just... would you just hug me?! all right? your boyfriend was accosted by an angry mob, and he needs to be hugged.
too bad.  you could use some sun. really.
rule two:  without alternative, use yourself as a shield.
maybe they will.
wait a minute - who elected you leader a this outfit? since we been followin' your lead we got nothin' but trouble! i gotten this close to bein' strung up, n'consumed in a fire, 'n whipped no end, 'n sunstroked, 'n soggied -
coming with you.
okay, now, how far's your truck?
what's the matter?
{suddenly unctious) oh, but of course ...
the hospital?  oh, that's right -- you're a doctor.  ha-ha.
that's the way he is.
oh, i don't know.  because no girl in her right mind will have me?
yeah, but i hear she gives a mean blow job.
english!
we're awaiting a decision, excuse me.
salome -- what a woman! what a part! the princess in love with a holy man.  she dances the dance of the seven veils.  he rejects her, so she demands his head on a golden tray, kissing his cold, dead lips.
jesus christ, how can you be so stupid?
come on.
what do you want?
watch what happens.
no. keep rubbing.
i love her.
they check in alone?
the phones are working?
i know that...
such as?
calls for speculation.
shit! look at this mess!
i'm totally serious!
i'm not sure i have two.
about us.
no, i don't get you...
i don't.
we learned he'd found the immigration notaries in liverpool and traced them to new york.  then he figured out the birth records in church hill...
will you go to her and tell her right in front of me she's nothing to you?  right out loud so i can hear?  tell her she's nothing, tell her she's nobody, just dirt?  will you do that?
the gun he means.
oh... well, i'm very sorry...
no, nothing.
well, has your majesty considered what napoleon's alternatives might be, if you simply chose to ignore his note?
so what were you fucking around for, then?
fleet encourages marriages among flight officers. you'd probably get a promotion out of it.
didn't these - professionals - figure he had a girl in the room?
oh, come on, stop stalling. grab yourself a cue.
he was trying to eat a second chocolate bar. your grandma said, "no." he tried to take a bite, so i grabbed it.
the first thing is i don't like people talking when i'm talking so the two of you, shut up.
what are you doing?
you'll have to make up your own mind about that.
maybe what?
yeah.
you really liked phelps, didn't you?
i'm going back to the institute.
yes. i do.
for you.  i want you to know, simone appreciates you all working for scale.  but why am i thanking you? simone can thank you herself.  she insisted on speaking with you before filming begins.  she's on the line now.
-- the nazi he knifed?
be careful. you're in it now. and it's gonna get mean.
that's okay.
don't worry about the loans. i'm doing good dad and it's gonna stay that way now... least buy yourself a new suit.
don't worry, honey, i'll protect you.
few days ago.
"but new struck nine."
but sir! federation starship approaching.
just stay calm, use your head. it'll be all right.  just the same, though...  guess you better swear me in.
sorry. do you suppose susan could just bring her crutches? oh, stupid question. tell her i hope  she feels better.  susan's mother, she can't baby-sit tonight.
fairy tales?
-what's the surprise in that, this is africa?
first, that boat is in international waters. i'm claiming it for salvage. one-third of that gold is mine.
it's only on exhibit at the queen's museum this month. even if you could get into the museum, the mask bas its own security system. a special, randomly programmed interval code.
were.  isn't that what you mean?  were. because he's dead, isn't he?  and that's why you've come.
we all have paths to follow.  you hope yours will lead you to me.
oh well he sure did a beautiful job. pink and gold are my favorite colors.
i'd rather not talk about it.
patience, lt. . patience.
wow.
take laddie.
i don't want to hurt anybody. i just want to go home.
overflowing with love.
it happens. take it easy.
probably.  what movie is this?
because she'll have taken one look at your clothes and your car and started thinking of ways to turn the situation to her advantage. she's already got you staying with her, for fuck's sake. 
when i'm on my bike i feel like a wild person.  better than any sex i've ever had.
what?
-i would never make excuses- but a fire broke out- the light was bad- he kept moving-
look at the collar on that coat...
we don't know.
who's looking for you?
it's too...
if rick has the letters, he's much too smart to let you find them there.
maybe...
omar--
louella, please, be reasonable, i understand you have problems with orson's picture but maybe we can work something out--
go home.
heard where?
i didn’t intend it that way... it just happened.  he heard from laurence that you’d been back.  that we’d argued. he asked why and it just happened; i told him everything... i couldn’t help it. wanted to see him scared. i had never seen him scared before, you see...
it's always been our policy -
yeah...
to hell with procedure!  we paid a bloody fortune for this slut, and we can do whatever the hell we like with her, whether the church likes it or not -- is that clear?
he won't kill her. -- goddammit!
who?
we're on our third pitcher of beer. just ask me.
you're a fuckin' mess.
i mean it's hairy -- they got some pretty heavy ordnance, boy -- i've lost a few recon ships in there now and again.
white meat will be fine...
inside every semi-conductor... you have two particles, with opposite charges, separated by an impassable barrier...
that's against the law, isn't it? i can't wear a uniform anymore.
umm. three i believe. but i'm not sure.
this is a crime bill, shep.  killing a couple ducks won't get it through committee.  besides, shep, i told you...  i don't shoot babies and i don't kiss guns.
people didn't complain?
i don't have to...
...that's not true.
getting to what?
oh my dear child.
and still mrs. harold ryan?
i'll get it, sit down, miss daniels. do you want a sweater or something? a quilt?
natural fear. her grandmother went insane and took her own life. and the blood is in madeleine.  scottie, i ask you to watch her closely.
really -- you went with him for two years.
where's your wife, jake?
then why tell me?
i don't want to hurt you.
you'll never realize what a rare treat you've given me.
yes.
that's me.
you're tense.  what are you all uptight about?
totally understood.  totally wrong of me to talk shop after the day you've had.  totally sorry.
what do you want, then?
fuck it.
he never jokes... perhaps the professor could use your computer.
zuzu, be quiet.  put in colleen's disc.  number two.
sounds great.  excellent.  though-, ahm... there's this guy who's coming to work at the gallery, from england...
could you please put my glass on the table?
you do see me standing here, right?
because it's right.
you knew del?!
this may feel a tad awkward, my friend, but it needn't be. i've merely come to oversee your work here; understood?
what?
during the florida primary, you wrote a letter on muskie stationery saying scoop jackson had a bastard child. you wrote another that said hubert humphrey was out with call girls.
she doesn't answer me either.
as a matter of fact, i stopped by to tell you that i haven't forgotten your problem and that we're still on the case.
not in years.
no, there's...
i don't know nothin' about no kaufman.  he's been ridin' my coattails, smearing my reputation. been usin' my good name, to get places.
no, rachel...
okay, kid, i have a deal for you! if you want out of hell, all you have to do is collect 10 proofs of purchases from 'snacky smores.'  they're rich, chocolatey and really hit the spot. bring me ten proofs of purchases and we'll grant you any wish you want.
okay.
the little shit lied to me about that guy!
baby, don't be like that.
what?
yes.
who?
what about the notes?
shhhh... you hear that?
resurrection.
yes?
your last chance. give me the name.
this is a major screw up on your part, goddamn it!
i don't know. i'm so... i can't believe she'd be so goddamn immature!
it's actually been giving me freddy nightmares.
first time i ever heard that.
i resent your tone, sir. i have men who are missing -
i never break a date.  scout's honor.
do you mind if i come down and see it?
he hasn't so far.  i'm the one who can make a mistake.  that's what scares the shit out of me.
because i say so.
like you really care.  like any of you give a shit what happens to me.
i thought you might be asleep.
kill him!  tribuus -- execute that bastard.
quiet!
the antibiotics weren't working.  it's what i believe, george.
did you move the bumble bee pendant?
good luck then.
don't play innocent.  somebody named gordon cole.
why?
if not?
if they break or something. what is it, plastic?
no way, man.
i'm just going to keep asking until you answer. i'm sure there's plenty of tape.
having a good time?
ronald? that's crazy.
i don't know.
yes. on my torso.
that's all we need.
we ran a trajectory simulation.  if they carry on along that path, it's possible they'll make intra-orbital insertion.
now, monsieur, you have no right...
listen, rock, you're a very lucky guy.
i'm going to have one of those big beautiful steaks.  and... let's see... to start...
worst comes to the worst, we got his car for security.
close the fucking law book!
we drinkin' buddies now?
when i thought about you i was mostly hating you. where've you been hiding?
oh please, is that as articulate as you can be after all the time i spent teaching you? we've discussed wittgenstein, for christ's sake. not that you ever had anything very original or challenging to say on the subject.
to front for him. so elliot is workin' out the deal between them and his boss, a big movie producer named lee donowitz.
just like we all have fantasies, right? things only we know, that we don't share.
ethan, you're not making sense. let me go in and talk to kittridge. i'm going to tell him you had nothing to do...
i'm alone.
i'll tell or we're bringing -
i want to be near you!
not at all.
you open 'em up and there's the sayings, stories, little bites of insight. it's the p.p.p. six day week.
i can't blame anything on hal. it was me.  i play it back in my mind everyday.
i already did, it's a totally barbaric custom...but on you, it looks good.
or be up past ten or fraternize with other patients.
what are you doing now?
how much further?
oh, the boy has a mouth, now if only he had an arm.
good.  you sat in front...i saw you there...
but, mr. m. -
a gentleman left a message requesting a lunch, but i assured him...
yeah.  she is.  but you know what?  that's why i'm helping her.  so she can get some medicine to make her feel better.
nome?  i figure you'd be a whaler, coming from there.
this guy said he was a friend of lauren's. he had like paint all over his face.
always do.
sure. we aim to.
seventeen.
down there.  and i'm nervous.
you keep calling me dmitri.  you really shouldn't.
how do you mean?
white bear lake?
this is special agent ray nicolet with alcohol, tobacco, and firearms. would you mind if we looked in that bag?
you know... i think that you've gotten the wrong impression about me. i think in all fairness, i should explain to you what it is that i do. for instance, tomorrow morning i'll get up nice and early, take a walk down over to the bank and walk in and see you, and, uh... if you don't have my money for me, i'll crack your fuckin' head wide open in front of everybody in the the bank. and just about the time that i'm comin' out of jail, hopefully, you'll be comin' out of your coma. and guess what?  i'll split your fuckin' head open again. because i'm fuckin' stupid. i don't give a fuck about jail.  that's my business. that's what i do. and we know what you do, don't we, charlie? you fuck people out of money and get away with it.
yes, sir.
well--i haven't needed much law so far--what i'd like to get first is a little common sense--
i'm afraid there's nothing i can do about it, mr. mitchell.
it's alright.
but you've never figured out a way to win.
gonna be like money from home.
and i am his.
you're convinced the crew could still be alive? after seven years?
fifteen hundred.  we'll have to stop somewhere to refuel.
we're aware of your position.
i didn't come here to drink scotch.
sure.  can i ask you one more thing? you haven't published anything in a while.  how come?
when i was a kid, i thought i was gonna be this fantastic wonderful heroic human being.
don't i usually kiss my wife?
the airport! hey, wait a minute.
thanks for loading me on the stage. i know now why you did it.
i said give me time.
two main players plus three.
hey to bluestar, as your broker all i can advise is hold on to that stock dad...
mother, please...
well?
not exactly, but with your great voice, it'll be a huge hit. honest.
what if it hadn't been wes?  what if...i mean, accidently, what if i had...
leave me alone.
what does that have to do with you?
yes indeed. i need protection.
does he speak english?
i could shoot your cousin eddie.
huh?
could i have it, please.
he already thinks you're out of your mind, louise, that don't carry much weight with darryl.  are you at work?
i am calm!
i'll be down in a minute
almost three years, isn't it? and have i ever done anything to hurt you?
not if i know mary. when she rides into sonora, you'll be with her. and mighty glad to be there after this. i don't see how you stood it as long as you did.
you're losing me.
but what if you need more money?
prepare yourself, drew - i am --
what?
thank you, sir.  but i expect a certain amount of pain.
sorry, ma'am.  we're investigating obscene phone calls and mail threats to a certain mrs. dottie hinkle.
don't be long. i'm afraid with all these tough guys here.
i'm sorry, rob, but i'm struggling here.  i don't understand any part of this conversation.  you're asking me what i would think if you told me that you hadn't seen a film that you've seen.  what am i supposed to say?
is this the bottle that was found on the nightstand?
there are other plays...
see!  that's what i like about you, man!  you're just sharp as a razor blade.
not this time, kat.
but, he didnít know about you.  in all fairness, ethan, claire was never convinced her charms would work with you. but i was supremely confident - having tastes the goods.  "thou shall not covet thy neighbourís wife", ethan.  oh, ethan is in love with you, claire, make no mistake about it.  and like all the worldís lovers, heís tortured by the same, one pathetic question - "does she feel the same way i do?"
we should be.  everybody wants what we have.
no...
sure, on me.  i got diner's club.
what'd neptune tell you?
thanks for cleaning my flat and sending my money, all right?... come on, i need you. it’s important.
well, sir - it occurred to us that he might be an agent of a foreign power. but, we ruled that out, as they invariably are provided with too much documentation, too much american identity... we, uh...don't quite know what to make of it yet, sir... but we'll keep on top of it, mr. president - we'll come up with the answer.
are you figuring on going back to ames to play minnesota fats again? is that what's on your mind?
why do they do that?
it's the treasure, that's what it is.
no.  and you don't seem like the type who takes orders from him.
you sound like that all the time.
you gave us names? what are you, the "face" of the fantastic four now?
they're next on the list.  we have to find them.
i wouldn't mind another b.e.e.r.
honey.
yeah kay, i'm here.
think about this. if we just come up with a story and stick to it, we should be all right.
you haven't got your wings. yeah, that's right.
oh, i'll bet you he has a babe with him right out of a triple-x video. oh, oh, pony, come on, give it to me! stud! oh!
i'll have it tonight. nine o'clock? ten?
you're off the hook, ozzie.  but batman is decidedly <u>not</u>.
in english, please.
he mentioned a name, at the very end. "mofet..." any followup on her?
i'm with captain hamilton.
well, fust off...
no, it - it - nicky, when you asked me if you could come out here, what did i tell you? i mean, you asked me, and i knew you were going to come out no matter what i said, but what did i tell you? do you remember what i told...
but i'm worried. i'm hearing all kinds of things. paulie.  you know me all my life.  i've always done the right thing.
nancy.
i saw the longing in your eye --
well, i guess you'd like to see the big tamale? follow me.
was there visual contact?
how'd you find me?  what's happening?
there's nothing fast enough to catch that. forget it. it's over.
well, maybe i am.  but you're fired.
jack...
now you know.
damn.  let's go.
um-<u>hum</u> ...
that's not so good for you, my friend.
this is healthy? i'll probably die of pneumonia tomorrow and this is healthy.
they're friends of our enemy.
you two better quit it.
my __ex__ wife seems to have ripped off my camper.
i don't know it was made out of driftwood and dipped in sulfuric acid.  it was out there...
i think you could have.
kill them.  of course.  but why stop there?  why should only batman and robin die while the society that created them goes unpunished?
i'll take his place, all right?  put the gun to my head.
because it's in the big chill.
three whole weeks.
get on the bus.
he used a real gun. they should throw his ass in jail.
my mind's lovely.  and yours?
i'd double it and add 20.
nothing.  i said nothing.
sure.  blood gets all <u>over</u> your hand, sheriff, ask any fisherman.
you also have a power, conner.  it is why you have survived.
wait a minute.  there's an apartment in that area called the castle arms.
are you more satisfied now sexually, austin?
what went down?
vicky, it's not a space shuttle launch, it's sex.  so did you do the physics write-up?
well, i'm a very well-funded old son of a bitch.  you go.
you got a bathroom i can use before we hit the road?
first principles, clarice. simplicity. read marcus aurelius. of each particular thing, ask: what is it, in itself, what is its nature...? what does he do, this man you seek?
sometimes you have to tell a small lie to get to the bigger truth.  as for a photo -- if you can't do it, i know twelve million people who can.
you're twenty-two, aren't you, ray?
whoa!
who?
enough with the barbie n' ken shit. i know.
i didn't want to come right down the road, where they could see me.
the ones in this town, yes! you encourage their growth, their habit. you're the source in this area, and we're going to shut you down for good! for good, cancer-merchant!
you think so? joyce says she's timid.
oh.
what's that, five instead of ten years jail.
we swim.
you believe this?  the kid won't come out.  i'm playing 'camptown races' for him and the next thing i know he's locked himself in the bathroom. there's nothing sharp in there, is there?
yes.
a joke is a story with a humorous climax.
why should you be the only one.
oklahoma city.  jimmy's gonna wire me some money, and then...
claims he was there with a married woman. doesn't want to mention her name.
she loved me.  she wanted to see me every night.
mom, i hate to break this to you, but there's a whole other species out there you're neglecting.  if you've forgotten, they're called 'men'.  sometimes referred to in more colorful language.
i'm out, dad!
who told you?
a bad mother. by any standards. i've thought about it, you know, from your side, since then. i know just how bad i was.
now this is important. make sure you leave the house when you make the call. you understand? do you hear me? it's important.  call from an outside phone. i mean it.
are you kidding me?  are you fucking kidding me?
that's all right.  what are you drinking?
what?  why?
eve. eve harrington.
i see. you have calculated in terms of hunger.
--what time is it?
yeah. anyway, there aren't any photographers around.
we know each other well enough for me to care how i put something to you which could wipe you out. so i will phrase things the way i think they should be phrased.  all right?
max sayer -- national echo.
he does make some funny noises.
we ran the i.d.  i could have told you that.
cuttin' the heads off parkin' meters, captain.
trust me, this ain't one of those times.
now look, boy, get a grip on yourself. rose had a good life. she found her. right, didn't she? she triumphed over everything, what are you blubbering about?
you're not funny.
well... i... i don't want to be rude, but... it's generally known that --
thank christ we got a witness.
the kid needs a man to show him --
...the house, the 1835.  the original <u>kitchen</u>, of course, burned in 1960, as part of a spate of fires...
the hemorrhaging... the neural damage is irreparable. i'm frankly surprised he still has use of his motor functions.
kyle, check it out.
she's fine, as if you cared.
agnes... agnes...
well sir, perhaps i should explain...
business first.  i went into the "warrants" system and erased your records.  you're clean.  in fact, you're now on the informant payroll.
i think the building's okay. at least for the time being.
i'm tired, hector.  i know this because you're beginning to not bug me.
be honest, i can't say i did it all myself. my grandma helped me get the words right.
yeah. i did it.
...would you, would you call him up.  i'll give you my number, and ask him...
i was just passing by and wondered how you were.
good. there's nothing to be afraid of. if you co-operate with us, you will be on the plane for new york tomorrow... yes?
people more serious about their work. you know how to drive this thing or do you just like looking good in it?
she doesn't know what we're up to. and we can't afford to let her find out.
so she say, "you're spilling the milk." so she kept talking about these coupla drops of milk i spilled, so she got me so mad, so i said, "mama, you wanna see me really spill some milk?" so i took the bottle, and i threw it against the door. i didn't throw it at her. that's just something she made up. she goes around telling everybody i threw the bottla milk at her. i didn't throw it anywheres near her. well, i was sorry right away, you know, but she ran outta the house.
oh, if there is only time!
well, i've been moody and dissatisfied.
not good enough rodgers. not good enough at all. black terrorists on the floor of a state capitol. i will not say this again, these negro commies are to be stopped and now. you tear them down. either from the outside or the inside.
well, i think you're cute.
fuck you for asking me that.
i'm a lawyer. the firm is thinking about renovating. everything dates back to the sixties.
i believe dr mccoy is not in the best of moods.
have you seen 'pumping iron?'
you're right!  self-pity never got anyone anywhere.  let's go back and finish our dinner.
yeah?
nothing's wrong.  i just want to get something straight.  you agree that there's a good chance these two shootings are somehow related, right?
uh-huh.
dang, you are right, mr rothstein, i am so sorry.
i'll watch for him, sir.
it will... take me from <u>you</u>...
let's see if she can get my model back.
uh, it's just--that woman out there-- that horrible hag. she's the one who keeps following me on her creepy little scooter--and now she's built a hut in the back..why did you...
i'm checking on that.  i think we should meet thursday night at nine to talk about it.
hello... my name is john merrick. i am very pleased to meet you.
no.
i asked you a question, honey -- were you there too --
but carl was a fisherman.  and successful at it.
i've had some experience.
i don't mind it. it was harder before the war. trying to keep up appearances. now it's patriotic to be poor.
i don't know. all i know is i got to get out of this place.
ah, damn -- the fucking jerks -- my, god.  they want to fire me.
i pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
then where's the goddamn conway twitty coming from?
forty-five all total.
i was in a bowling-alley.
really, which one? i bet it was the guy with the prada shoes.
there's no scar. corvis made it up.
you gonna wind up working at a school crosswalk.   that doughnut's chocolate you, know.
for?
do peter sellers again.
looks like he's sulking.
father's a surgeon.  i can even stitch in a pinch, wouldn't be a bad idea here.
what!
shhh...
i have to talk. is that okay?
he's drawing an isthmus... he's saying we're on an isthmus.
maelcom... do you think there's a hell for computers?
looking?  looking?  you've found someone i'd say.  heh?  yes!
suit yourself.
oh.
i changed the conditions of the test. i received a commendation for original thinking.  i don't like to lose.
no.  no i'm not.
...you got your doctor's testimony. why do you need me?
i appreciate the offer.  and it's tempting.
mary clarence, could you?  mary lazarus, you're terrific, but...  could you help us?
i can't get enough of it.
i'm afraid it is a bad start, friend, 'cause my name isn't baxter, and he ain't hawley.
can i do something for you still? you're not too rich, or too famous that i can't help you?
did you?
no it wasn't.
mrs. leeds was a good-looking woman. i'd want to touch her skin in an intimate situation, wouldn't you?
i feel sorry for him.
handsome, thirties, psychologist...
we're down to seven minutes 23 seconds..
tis a delicate operation, lad. requires a bit of engineering... next!
you got me.
what if you lost your keys?
think!  can we stop it?! block it up?!  shut down the line somewhere?!  think!
she's in there right now saying the same thing about you.
what happened?
you're worried for my safety.  i'm touched.
you're failing english . . . you used to be top of the class- pauline i'm doing my own writing!
i didn't mean to --
no! the man in the moon!! who's driving this thing?
what?
how do you figure?
the least you could do is nod and act sympathetic --
not too sure about that.
tell mrs. washington i am compelled to stay a while longer.
argento's good, but lewis is completely demented. we're talking buckets of goo. red corn syrup everywhere. and fake brains up the yin-yang.
thank you.
... the truck fell into a very deep crevasse.  we weren't able to save the equipment.
my play.
who?  i'd have to have somebody i can trust.  when were you born -- i mean, what sign of the zodiac?
why do they call you wolf?
the rex.
i'm afraid, in the present situation you'll have to learn to think that way.
well, i-if-if you have some free time...
'dear miss laury'...he spells it with a y instead of an i...e...wouldn't you think he'd know...
mm-hm.
i was trying to score some dope.
then, tis not for chastity? methought you kept a naked blade twixt you and any maiden chanced spend the night.
then why are they holding us here? why don't they destroy us right away?  economically, it's not sound at all.  very much unlike....
c'mon. what're ya tryin' to be? the phantom lady?
yes, sir.
this is weird, mulder.
she's flying to new york.  she's been nominated for a silver mike...
baby, take it easy.
oh...f-for a long time.  ever since you first came to the club.
on the contrary, your eminence.  it seems to me the man is preparing his own cross.
for a thief. a mole. i vetted the source, marty. he's real. if it does nothing more than narrow the list of suspects, it's a bargain at ten times the price.
there's water in your bathroom.
did you rig it to do that? you're so clever.
why not...?
no.  no, i didn't.  who tells me anything?  i been kept in the dark so long, i'm getting used to it.
do you know you were humming?
he's clever. he had help.
and you were gonna pay me back?
the guy i was with. is he all right? how did i get to london?
he got away. i had him. he got away.
finish what my son started.
she's left before...
i mean it or i wouldn't say it.
no-one.
the point being that him, the networks don't want black people on television unless they are buffoons.
you a sailor man?  that'd be the life.  drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away. a man could pretty well disappear like that.  just sail away until all he was was a memory.  i guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
in ruhengeri?
great.
sheila'll be at "tops".
no.
... you hate weddings, you never go.
you're implying th...
the pelt is black.  it's a kind of man.
major, we're discussing a man of genius, i don't want...
what do i do?
pretty embarrassed, to be honest. i had him.
no, acrophobia isn't a crippling thing. it just means i can't climb steep stairs or go to high places, like the bar at the top-of-the-mark. but --  -- there are plenty of street-level bars in this town.
come on brenna, your ass is already in a sling, don't drag me into it.
hello.
yeah. i'm surprised. it's really old...  travels well though.  you know, the world looks a lot better from up here.
okay, okay.  listen:
no, no!  not yet.  i feel bad -- i've jerked 'em around so many times.
you're drinking it.
i love it!
open the suitcases, unpack the body parts and reunite the limbs.
can you think of a better reason?
i'll make it an even five hundred. plus an extra hundred if you get me to lax on time.
moral turp...you're on my home court, friend, i have the mayor and the town behind me, and forget making your movie: i may own the studio when i get through with you: i got a civil suit, i got rape, i got collusion...
yeah?
you'd tell me anything to save your pathetic life.
it looks that way.
i have already heard about this cafe, and also about mr. rick himself.
we were making a commercial down at the mayor's office, and there was this young, good-looking salesman...
he's asleep.
june 3rd, god willing, i'll marry your dad.  and then i <u>will</u> be your stepmom. and right now, i'm not looking forward to th...
mmm... i love it when you talk like that.
clever girl.
why can't we?
yeah.
they're drifting toward me... i think they're magnetic!...
are you out of your mind?  i still have nightmares, my reputation's a joke, my leg is shot -- you think i need more of that?
you guys are from the british museum, right?
tumescent!
rollo's the reason i became a cop. i wanted to catch the guys who thought they could get away with it.  it was supposed to be about truth and justice and rollo.  but somewhere along the way i forgot all that... how about you, jack? why'd you become a cop?
it comes down to leaders.  if our leaders are ordinary men who truly believe; if they go into the forests with the troops, eat what they eat, fight with them, perhaps to die?  the most common soldier will defy your most depressing expectation.
yeah. hurry up though.
i thought they'd talk to him. try to get him to dummy up.
it would be a lot easier for me to show you instead of tell you.  but first things first.
yes, abbe?
we met on the beach.
out here, you always fight for survival.  you have to be part of a gang to stand a chance.  slowly, your gang becomes your family.  all that dark cloud stuff is just to scare people and make my life easier.
the police say i scared him off. it wasn't me, sid.
businessman.  owns a department store in des moines, i think.
what about the shit they write?
goddamn you!
susan, don't go!  susan, please!
this is a considerable move up for you, daniel. the temptation of having so much money might be too much for you.
why george, you big softie...
everybody except the girl who's supposed to handle the kitchen. annie.
good luck on your mission, 007.
what?
right.  now it's used by somebody from the juarez cartel, one of his lieutenants...  who knows?  every damn day there's birthday party. at first i thought they must have three hundred children, then i realized they're taunting us.  three miles away and we can't touch them. ha, ha, ha.
i spoke with the woman who saved your life. you're lucky she came along when she did.
we'll work something out, joe.
of course.
yeah.
it'll keep them fresh. if they get too dry, they'll break. and you don't want that to happen, do you?  tobacco is a plant, and it needs the same loving care you'd give an orchid.
i'm kidding. hello?
ok. come back this afternoon, about four o'clock. if you give me the number of the case, i'll have the dossier here waiting.  my tailor,... well worth the investment.
be careful.  don't stay any longer than you have to.
i am zuul.  i am ...
what's your shpiel, santa?
she wanted to go out to my car, something about my car...
cover me.
take it easy, clark.
i just need to go a little slow.
i regret it, ma'am, but i have the responsibility of training thirty other doctors to attend a thousand children like your own.
yeah, but we got a little bit done. and if you do a little and i do a little... then maybe the next guy'll do a little...
my friend, with the funny hand.
it means... i see.
thank you.  we met last week, at the wajda film.  you won't remember. we didn't actually speak.
we'll leave first thing in the morning.
then we must go there too.  to rule. finally - to rule!  and then you shall have what you want.
wait a second.  you're steven reign? you're big time.  you own all them big hotels.  what are you doing in hong kong?
don't say any more.
a mother-fuckin' peace conference.
presumed dead.  no one knows.
only half of you would get there.
hate that.
it's a fortune box.
i get off in another twenty minutes.  i thought maybe we'd all get a bite together.
what the hell do you think's the matter.  i could wait for you someplace.
put a tap on her phone.
eh, if the bootie fits...
huh.  jeez.  well, so, did he--is that yoga?
you won't even tell me your name. what's shocking about a name?
where's sid?
that's the rock star thing.
yorgi asked me to.
eh.  if i ever get out from under. maybe take may to france or somethin'.
did he have a wife?  did he had a girl friend?  did you know them?
what kendall said -- "the type of guys you don't feel comfortable going to sleep around." that's what dunbar said about childs to the letter.
beat it out and get hold of some guys.
you can't threaten me --
it likes all the sappy stuff: 'cumbaya,' 'everything is beautiful,' 'it's a small world' -- but it loves jackie wilson.
long pause) you know it.
no dear, i'm fine. now what kind of host would i be if i put my guests to this kind of work.
horses.
praying.
i got more scared.
a ragione. a ragione. 
listen tom, i let my cab go; can i come in to call another one?
not the drugstore!
what did he ever do to you?
where you going?
for supplies, you drive.
okay, whatever. come on chris!
who are you?
... only for one day and we'll be back tomorrow night.
i know, me too.  what should we do about it?
i looked for you, angie, before i cut out, but i couldn't find you.
who said anything about love?
what are you, a theater checker? you check up on the box office girls. make sure they're not rippin' the place off.
thank you, sir.
my need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale cannot be, um, corrected, but i have no other way to fulfill my needs.
yeah, well, what are you gonna do?  you and me, pablo?  are we good?
someone died here. it's tapu.
i'll bargain with you. how many of you are on the island?
let me think about that.
benjamin, what does it possibly matter?
he said he's in charge...
sit down, jake.
what's being photographed?
about what?
you're a movie buff?
oskar -
i would say he's pretty depraved.
who are you?
no, we have a stone killer trying to make a point.
i don't know what a retort is, but it's simple.  mantan - the new millennium minstrel show is universal.  it's not just for negroes in compton or 125th in harlem.  this is america.  our ancestors helped build this country, we got a right, just like everybody else.  i'm not gonna box myself in. this show makes people think, and they're laughing at the same time.
she had a... a hole in the palm of her hand!  she could have bled to death.
why?
now i can get out a here -- if i can find a way out.
good idea!
i don't know. i was thinking, maybe i'd be a vet or something, cause i like animals and stuff.
go have fun. not too much.
it happened too fast.  he was in the back, quiet and calm and boom! he was out - and gone.  we...we fanned out...stanton must have let his guard down!
i don't understand.
give me a break, alex.  what are we going to tell them?  excuse me, officer, but there's some sort of electronic monster loose in the phone lines.  i'd think twice about calling any of those 976 numbers...
right. you're right.
roger, document as much as you can, but keep moving.  we're on a tight timeline.
well, i suggest you speak to him, then.
harold!
yeah, no kidding. good! it opens at 9 a.m. be there!
just a little queasy...
nicky wanted to take over. he wanted to go after gaggi, go after the skim, go after everything and everybody.
that soulless monster gets no tears from me.
it's choco. and he's not my boyfriend. he's a bounty hunter.
yes.
okay... i'll go back.  but just let them know, first they ain't gettin' latka.  they're gettin' tony!
good, good. drinking some good wines and kicking back, you know. so what's happening? still no word?
it won't hold!
no...i'm in some trouble...
nice guy eddie.
yeah. do you paint?
yes, with these suits.  we've used them before on atomic tests... odd- looking, aren't they?
i know the words... fucking psycho fucking bullshit, that's the words.
a little.
we don't know who he is...  ... i'm going to talk to that little girl.
and what are inappropriate levels of hostile attention?
i'm a good friend of hers.
i don't want your mother to believe something like this but what am i to think?
yeah, it's been a while, but i... i remember the basic ideas...
waldnit von schnechter. prewar.
would you two excuse me for a moment?
well, you know i'm not going to show him the whole amount. he'll see fifty thousand.
no, that door over there.
here, now, you're broke, aren't you?
hah!!! those cagey rascals! those sly dissemblers! those, uh...  they've finally pulled the wool over everybody's eyes!
happy days.  when you're bigger, bill, i'll teach you the googly.
that asshole's not my friend! i barely know him!  i hate his fucking guts --  -- ellis, for christ's sake, tell him you don't mean shit to me --
yeah. i'll find it. it's in harlem.
-- bad?!
you say you saw some activity here?
i'll bet he's got an opinion on the stock market too. this apartment is already ahead of its time. i call it the "demolished" look. they've already heard about it at house and garden and they're coming next week to photograph it before it gets... lived in. is that alright? i'd love to have it in my portfolio.
oh.  hi.  i work in your office. i was on the junket to the conference. i'm --
why not?  you think i can afford a suite like that on my salary? is jean-claude done yet?						*
i needed to see if you were a cop.  i'm a popular man with the police, sam, and whenever they try to catch me they always do it with an inside guy -- some man on some job who seems more trustworthy than all the others put together.  and that's the guy you have to watch out for.  i hate cops...
it frightens you.
what do you mean, we must abandon?
did you?
good!  i prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.
where are they?
i'm saying it now!
i didn't leave.  i was just digging around.
in an hour there will be no stars. the air is filling with sand.
what are you going to do?
are you a doctor?
now i've got another lie to live down. thanks, jack.
lotta law around here.  just met the sheriff.
i am the muffin.
how did you...?
i see.  so you don't believe anymore that the company covered it up?
well you read this.
you being cynical, hennessy?
it'd have to be pretty good.
that's my morning's pay.
those are your clothes, silly.
what?
i had a man trip and fall in the parking lot once, sued me before i could bat an eyelash.
leaving?
yes?
thank you for saying that, but no. my business.
just get me outta here.
one more time would be nice.
it's bad news when you can't even bribe kids.
i just wanta play everyday despite small nagging injuries--and go home to a woman who appreciates how full of crap i truly am.
you don't wanna know.
should i?
the worst.  on the other hand, maybe i'm a man who can't pass up a chance for revenge against the black-hearted bastard who stole my ship and left me to die in the middle of the ocean -- twice! -- and who knows how to get what he wants.  now that's a great pirate.
brody...i don't know...  ...something brody!
no...  no doctor...
i can get you new evidence next week.
you don't know what he's built?! surely you don't think he kidnapped all those geniuses to have them make something as rudimentary as this.
what about kate?
they're all good ones.  satellites we've got can snap a shot of the boil on saddam's ass.
what do you mean if we should get out?
forget about the fucking toe!
and what did you say?
data, if you were following the boy and discovered this ship...
you can holla y'self hoarse. ain't gonna bend my will.  right or wrong, you gonna mind me.  gonna suffer you like jesus say, to the faithless and the perverse generation.
of course i knew your father. he was tall, thin, pleasant, and had a moustache like mine. always smiling. he looked like clark gable.
hm?
newcastle?  did you start that one?
it's far better thing that i do... holly, you and i aren't heroes, the world doesn't make any heroes...
didn't debbie deserve anymore?
i'm lucky i found it.  someone put your box of dresses under a pile of rags in the garbage.
who'd you go with?  that's not good.
i can't move.  i can't get out.
i won't <u>make</u> it to the police. they won't let me get there. you go.
i won't make any noise.
we're trying to scare them, not kill them!
well, if i have to, i have to.
apart from those shotguns.
try next of kin.
i don't know. i can't get the dialect.
yeah.  see you there.
at least, the cat comes back.
i'm thinking.
that's it!  the unbreakable line! we'll tie it to an arrow and fire it up into the timbers above the portculis... then, i'll climb up and chop down the drawbridge.
it was a veal stock, i thi...
i broke my ankle skating.  that ended that dream.
well, except for one thing.  i used to work at a smorgasbord, and, and the old people would flock there, and, and they loved to eat.  and they just jammed their mouths, you know?  the used to eat with their mouths open, and you know, it's just too much for me.  you get to be thinking about how short life is, and how maybe, maybe has no meaning because you wake up and you're frying burgers
he suspects that the culprits might be the very people who, uh, soiled your rug, and you're in a unique position to confirm or, uh, disconfirm that suspicion.
sue the shit out of 'em.
yeah, you can.  you could just quit.  people do it all the time.
get away, svengali.
you think people hate you.
oh, really?
hey.
it's the maintenance entrance. runs along the side of the tunnel. when they repaired it last year i worked on a piece about it.
lara --
no thank you, sir.  smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema, and may complicate pregnancy.
yeah.  he's around somewhere.
frank galvin. we've met before.
all right, get the stupid fuckin' rope.
sure, 'cause i didn't ask her if i could go.
i never did like the name geraldine.
only make bets i can't afford to lose.  only way to be 100% committed.
the cattle! this valley runs down to a clear creek. that's why we picked this spot, and that's why they don't want us here.
if he sees me, he'll run, so i'll get out here. you start talking to him about baseball or something while i sneak around behind and get down and you push him. when he falls we get him.
what?  you gotta be joking.
what's the matter?  the fight gone out of you?  i'm just gonna smash a headlight.  maybe two.
"a toast then, jedediah, to love on my own terms. those are the only terms anybody ever knows, his own."
who else but god could think this shit up?  i spend ten years building those fucking rooms to keep people out, now i gotta figure out how to get in.  god, man, he just loves the irony.
guy's got a fucking pink toilet, for christ's sake.
he's gonna be around a lot and i hope you are too, so...
how do you pay for one of those?
if you should fall sick we'll be careful. you need not worry.
when you get the ak, open up. you got me? open up.
as they used to say... all systems are go.
no?
booties for my father.  he gets cold in this hospital.
know what we need, man?... some rope.
i . . .
james, why don't we...?
no.
yeah.  have a pleasant vacation?
madeleine, a hundred miles south of san francisco there's an old spanish mission, mission san juan bautista. it's been preserved exactly as it was a hundred years ago as a museum. now, think hard, darling. you've been there before. you've seen it!
yessir.
yes.
you two are majorly demented. anyone ever tell you that?
trip? where to?
what the hell are you guys doing here?
i suppose i did.
well... if you think about it, then it would mean that maybe everything he's saying is true.
you are a liar!
"painted"?
and, he gets out there and he has five strokes on us. he has more concentration than anybody i've ever met. it's spooky how he can concentrate.
me?  oh, hell yes.  three.  i love 'em.  i love kids.  anything at all can and does happen.
i don't think that you would understand if i told you.
i pose an unacceptable danger to the public, remember?
yeah, the best.
i don't get it.
proof he's declawed. as for him, we buried him good and deep.
but my name's not...
twelve young, i don't have time for your games. now answer me or do i have to come out there myself?
they didn't think he'd be so cagey, that's all.  they'll get him next time.
it's a flat tire.  that's all.
you must believe me.
quiet.
it's a new deal.  ... coming with me tomorrow?
yea, art thou there?!
yes?
why?
aw, come on, baby...you're the girl of my dreams.
he moved out to rancho cucamonga with his cousin day-day.
what does he want?
i'm not your folks, man. you love this... susan?
i'll be alright. hurry up so we can get going... we got our own boat to catch.
you woulda?
i've already got something worked out.  be seeing you.
i guess it lacks a certain style.
right.
pick me up at my father's house at around seven. and don't be late this time.
all of them... which means <u>you</u> have just won a free membership at our store on second avenue.
when?
harry, you don't have to believe! i'm not even sure i believe. but if there's even a chance that spock has an eternal soul -- then that is my responsibility.
okay...
i have, i don't know, maybe a cigarette a week.
look at the bills. i can't. i'm not gonna put my daughter through what i went through.
my dad's in hell, and he's falling apart.
you mean i won't resist them.
yes, it is.
it's be best if you got to the point, cause i'm about ready to punch you in the face.
you got an idea?
i can handle it.
he's probably outside.  you know how he is. gets bored...

what she's going to do is get in my way.
there is no us, remember?
obviously, for precrime to function, there can't be any suggestion of fallibility.  after all, what good is a justice system that instills doubt?  it may be reasonable, but it's still doubt.

and...
well, okay, you're not privy to all the new shit, so uh, you know, but that's what you pay me for.  speaking of which, would it be possible for me to get my twenty grand in cash? i gotta check this with my accountant of course, but my concern is that, you know, it could bump me into a higher tax--
why do you have to see him?
suck me...beautiful?
wait a minute.
it was my choice.

and you've put it over--haven't you?
you do what you want.  you want to leave...you want to go kill yourself?
what do you look for?
he's clever and he's cautious in his way. if he knew i think he'd advise her to do what i want —- surrender herself to the police —— stand trial —— i don't think he knows.
no, then.
so?
he's over at the boat show. he'll be by later.  it's so beautiful here.
how'd he die?

he moves around a lot.  why?
well, it's a complicated issue--
i'm running a little late.  you see, i'm having a party at <u>the</u> club to introduce the new lead singer for black vomit.  everyone in the industry will be there, including our friend, don cleveland.
he really loves you.  come back to peking with me.  we'll find a solution.
tis not the wound, that's sure.  not a scar remains... we're talking about a spell; harder to repair than sword-work.
how could we go back to the wars with such pleasant company here..
i've been working night and day.  i haven't had time.
where are you?
you'll meet a rich man and he will give, you money.

i would like you to go quickly over to the resdence damien, and gather up a cassock for myself, two surplices, a purple stole, and some holy water, and your copy of the roman ritual. the large one. i believe we should begin.
mr rothstein. mr rothstein, i'm sorry. we've got some complaints about - about the noise.

black?

we were worried that ebby might get involved with the wrong crowd in professional baseball--we're so pleased, he met a christian woman.
there's a guy in here, hurt bad! we gotta get him to a doctor!
sleeping in the back.
i'm not gonna fire you.  i wanted to.  but then you got sick, and that woulda made me look like a shit.  you embarrassed me, erin.
oh, he's such a loser!

this case just got hot.  we pull on this string...
no, leave one. somebody's grandmother might want one.
all i know about movie trilogies is in the third one, all bets are off.
of course it matters. hey, hold on!
fucking men, col --
no idea.
you don't know, believe me. they bribe the guards. the guards turn a blind eye. they're bringing in cartloads, food, tobacco, liquor, french cosmetics, and the poor are dying all around them and they don't give a damn.
i'm hungry.
i got the twister game for later ...
will you get the fuck out of here.
you must, betsy. they'll have to believe you.
carl and i were friends from childhood.  he was loyal, that's not a mistake.
... where is everybody?!  i'm half frostbit!
don't lie to me.
there isn't anyplace else --  except the worker bar.
yes, to misery. let me pour you some more wine.
and what's that supposed to mean?
we're very sorry about that.  some of our men were on the scene of the accident.
he was very ill, i stayed with him for a while.
fine.
it couldn't possibly interest you.
take the number one chair, ibanez. follow all instructions of you supervisor.
he can't find organa major.
i'm not rich people.

it won't.  as long as i'm here.
morning.

curtis is always more complicated than he seems. even now.

i was saying...thinking maybe i'd get my own quiz show someday, jimmy. just like you!
lip reading.
are you sure you saw that?  in the rain -- it may have <u>looked</u> like it changed shape --
well, i guess it's 'cause he loves you so much. he's jealous and worried.
michael!!
i don't blame people for their mistakes, but i do ask that they pay for them.
how do you know? huh? when nobody knows that much?
uh huh?
i guess you didn't kill nobody then.
was someone rude to you?
the damn thing's been floating around for god knows how long and it hasn't hit anything yet. so we take it easy. a little of the old push pull.
no. sara, you don't understand...
nothing is wrong. everything is the way it has to be. in my left coat pocket is a packet. passports, hotel reservations, tickets.
yeah, okay.
well, sir, i remember an example that pointed out that if a system was safe on 99.99% of the days of the year, given average luck it would fail in thirty years.
what do you mean?
maybe if i stick your fuckin' face through this window over here like, you know, you'll - you'll get unconfused. give me the fuckin' money!
but, but -- what would i do?
geniuses don't need good luck.  i do.
klaus tauber.
tell me about the first time.
there's no one left ...
one senator just gave a speech slurring us 57 times in 20 minutes.
you're just upset about jesse. we all are.
a grand.
yes, act naturally and we'll split this scene the way we came in, vanessa.
it's circumstantial.
sure.
oh, listen, i understand that there's always a risk... you know, i might have to take a loss somewhere.
what?
you shouldn't even carry cigarettes on board!
that darn kid. i never in my life expected her to get an a in arithmetic. math's is a practical science --- if she understands figures, she's well out of her own world of make-believe.
dill-wad...
and that's tough, isn't it?
adele... we gotta do something before early kills someone else.
great, wallow in guilt, you <u>sure</u> you're not jewish?
zulu may not wear shoes or trousers and the like but it don 't mean to say they got no brains. they'll watch us  and wait  and find our weaknesses.
we'll have to go into quarantine, maybe for quite a while.
there's going to be a pile up.  logs. bodies everywhere.  i saw it happen. it happened.
pam grier.
a lot of bad stuff happened here. it's as good a place as any for it to end.
a lawsuit?  you going to sue them?
because i can be! the same fucking cheek, goddamnit! why are you pulling my dick? do you think, do you really think, if betty finn's fairy godmother made <u>her</u> cool, she'd still act nice and hang with her dweebette friends? no way! uh-uh!
and now...
what man?
piece of cake.
no, i haven't. i guess i thought the name was familiar.  by the way, you discussed with senator paine where the camp was to be situated and everything?
twenty, sire! how about twenty? twenty minutes of continuous music. no recitatives.
ooooh, now the cards are on the table.
i detest comparisons made with oil.
oh, you're wrong. he told me --
how about a big mac?
here i am.
do you?
how long have you been together?
i understand the risks involved here. but there is nobody better qualified to go after sid 6.7 than barnes. and, there is nobody who knows him better than you. if a situation becomes volatile, you will find a way to quell it. i have complete confidence in you.
no shit.  you got someplace in mind?
first of all, let me tell you something -- you don't know shit. second of all, as far as <u>we</u> go, what time do you need?  what have we been doing here, except <u>time</u>?  have i ever... ever pressured you!?
stop, i beg you! have pity, i say! you're not my lover; you're a monstrous rouè!
hm?

turn on the light.
color me nauseous.
whaddup?
i would not presume to debate you.
i'm gonna finish packing tonight... i'll bring it over tomorrow sometime.
i know.  i just like to see you get all worked up.
don't listen to him. it's him. he's the one.
hey, <u>you're</u> the one who got me out here, turned me into a goddamn sled dog. an' now you 'spect me to go back like a <u>whipped</u> dog?
who's a killer?
no. she ordered them special. took her forever to find them. they've got this design on them with dolphins and our names engraved in sanskrit. we've got to go back. christine'll fucking crucify me.
what is it, spats?  what do you want here?
his.
fleaur-de-lis.  'whatever you desire.'
now who'd go and do...
to the craft?  none.  not a scratch.
i'll do whatever you want. you don't want me to ever see kayleigh again, fine. just let crockett go. besides, you kill him now and they'll stick you in juvy for sure. and i know you'd never leave your sister alone with your father.
god, i don't think so. better look in the house.
no i didn't say that.
hey, carlton's in town -- come out with the three of us.
sure, it you could find a towel in this bag.  i know my wife packed one in there...
you're impressed with her, aren't you?
come to the show with me. tonight i want you to see him with an audience.  they love him.
i did do that, didn't i?
yes.
you can get out of the dinner.
i'm sorry, frank.  all that talk about family. i just got emotional.
the massive fellow... brom.  for someone you call "friend," he misplaces a good portion of jealousy.
shut up.
we do favors for each other...
gilbert!  is he here too?  we might as well be living in the lobby.
the food is marvelous in cuba the senoritas are beautiful stop i could send you prose poems of palm trees and sunrises and tropical colors blending in far off landscapes but don't feel right in spending your money for this stop there's no war in cuba regards wheeler.
you were scared, weren't you?
to reach people, you have to feel something first... you write about the wrong things.  how can you feel for dog food?  the people at the gazette don't respect it, and neither do you.
eh?
well, i really don't drink...
sorry about this hand.  you know that feeling -- you're not completely embarrassed yet, but you glimpe tomorrow's embarrassment?
i've never been given a fair shot.
i want a consensus, bobby. consensus. either air strike or blockade. something everyone'll stand by even if they don't like it. i need it by saturday. make it happen.
i know.  one has to give americans "reasons" and make agreements to get them to do anything at all.  tiring, isn't it?  but that's the way of it here.
what are you doing?
somebody shut his lights. i guess the little guy sat in there, waitin' for his buddy t'come back.
did you find your father?
i'm sorry. i just assumed. your accent maybe. where are you from?
no.
the game will guide you.
is that a true story, or pretend?
guess i finally got bit.
it's attitude...how you carry yourself.
you called me so you could have a place to stay.
it'd make their heads explode.
no.  but let's do it, anyway.  it's gonna bug the shit out of harp.
do you have mrs. george for english?
quincy.  i know you left school early to throw your middle finger up at me.
no.  why?
my guess: he's wondering whether to get more fries or go straight to the chocolate sundae.

this is the police lock-up.  we're police.  how can we steal from ourselves?
i know.  i'm the one who shot him.

thank you.  i thought you were avoiding me.
you just drove by it.
six, six, six, pick up sticks.
maybe i'm not going to keep you here.  maybe i'm gonna blow your brains out.
give me your number.  i'll call tomorrow.  i'm just a little. i'm a little insane right now.  but it's going to be great.
well, whoever she is, she sure likes to read a lot.
i think -- she's crazy.
but you'll hurt your eyes doin it there. come sit at the table.
you'd better be, bro. you better be.
i'll bring him up to your loft.
i don't know, he doesn't listen to me. maybe he should...  get lost for a while. take a vacation. would that be so bad?
-- what?
mcgill. no, the marriage'll take place as planned.
we don't know.  when i have more i'll let you know.
gorkon had to die before i understood how prejudiced i was...
now wait...
you - you fuckin' moron, i'll be filling out paper work for the next two months because of you and this piece of shit, you...
what is that a threat? are you fuckin' threatening me, marcel?
i think you're making a mistake, sir.
yeah.
sheeet, you ain't. i had aplenty.
not our kind of people, you understand.
habeas corpus -- you have to have a body to have a crime.
you. what?
you'll think me very bold, sir.
it got so bad your father almost had to put me away.
i also have a couple of million in cash. call sonny benza.  ask if i can keep it.
i won't let you have it.
... the gardener?  ... yes, of course... mr. chance, this is ms. hayes.
yeah, i hit a three at the buzzer.
about what ?
i won't apologize for this. and i won't hide it. not for anybody.
use the phone, bernie, call him tomorrow, he'd like to hear from you.  where's your other shoe? never mind!  i don't want to know. some fantastic adventure, right? something really crazy.
yes.
how?
yeah, bitch, give me my apple. what's gotten into you?
maybe.  i said maybe.  what i mean is, ah...i don't think it'll really work out, but charley seems to want it, so...
the way we figure it, barbara flies to boston twice a week.  two bags per flight.  twenty-five pounds in each bag.
well, i'm not going to commit economic suicide on that flimsy evidence. we depend on the summer people for our lives, and if our beaches are closed, then we're all finished.
. . . tubby?
you're the devil, aren't you? that's who you are.
because these minority reports are destroyed the instant they occur.
we don't want to push her away. these are growing experiences.
as a matter of fact, i do sing a little.
well, i don't have hallucinations. honest.
thanks for showing me the bookstore. perhaps you could, uh, take me to an aa meeting sometime.  uh...uh, i'd love to see what goes on.

oh my dear yes, i bought a little ranch out west, sort of a tribute to the women of america who have cooperated with me in eliminating their odor by using my vaginal products, dew spray mist and yoni yum spray powder. a tax write-off, actually.
you can't quit, scully.
so how long have you known eddie?
but you never can tell. why don't you get that new rifle out of the wagon?
i thought it was wonderful.
if any form of pleasure is exhibited report to me and it will be prohibited.  i'll put my foot down; so shall it be - this is the land of the free.  the last man nearly ruined this place he didn't know what to do with it.  if you think this country's bad off now just wait 'till i get through with it.  the treasury is low on dough; the last man went and flew with it.  if you think we're short of money now just wait 'till i get through with it.  the country's taxes must be fixed - and i know what to do with it, if you think you're paying too much now, just wait 'till i get through with it. 
why in the hell would you want to watch my kids?
shhhhhh, quiet.
no, you won't. you'll die of cold out there and then i'll have to feel guilty. and i've already got more guilt than i know what to do with. [beat] do you want something to drink?
my back hurts, my skin. did i get burned? i hope to god i'm not burned.
god, i never thought of that.
good. i mean are we dead or something?
coming, eileen...
external srbs, orbital system engines. its just like the shuttles you flew in --
come on, bargain with me.
i don't know.

oh, yes, yes.

then go find her, donnie. don't let her get away.  she was right about the rabbits. go.
thanks.  coming from you that really means a lot to me.

never mind.
alonzo...
no, silly - i'm still in school you know. but i'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. you better be careful, jeffrey.
he's bluffing...
what? snap out of it!
rosemary, honey. good morning. i'm fine.  thanks for remembering.
looks like detroit.
because ... because dick helms knows too much ... if anyone in this country knows more than i do, it's hoover and helms!  you don't fuck with dick helms!  period.
that's the sky that's going to be over our roof every night, when we're done.
too bad.  because i'm terrible at 'yes.'
yeah, he'll crawl into my bed tonight, lie close to my body and keep me warm -- and rectify the evil in the men who live over us in this valley.
this was nothing like warsaw.  i held the truck then minutes, it's not that big a deal.
it sleeps twelve.  this is my friend daphne. she's a vassar girl.
i doubt it. how did you find out?
well, that's what we're trying to prove didn't happen. do you have any reason to believe it did?
go ahead.
<u>cheyenne</u>! what cheyenne?
yes, i know, fantastic, marvellous, wonderful - remember me to alison - and the - er - twins.
but doesn't the son of sam law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes?
he didn't tell me anything. all he said was saint severin...

do you want to deliver this baby?
we don't have that kinda time, boss, i don't think prague's gonna be around much longer. i've gotta go now. i've got a lot of bad guys to kill.
ha ha.  that's too much, georgie.  those days are over.  the rate is one-thousand dollars.  inflation, you know?
we probably shoulda filled up the car before we blew up that truck.
i was looking forward to this evening.
yesterday, one of our patrols picked up a man claims he was a prisoner with scar till only two days ago... he talks crazy but i brought him along...says he lives here...keeps mentioning a rocking chair.
we've told him we'll deal. what could he possible have to gain by --
of course!  it defines society!  to deny the precept is to say that order is an arbitrary distinction applied by the society itself!
all right, but make it quick.  shoes!  what size do you wear?
good. it's supposed to be.
no thanks. i had some. how would you like to take a walk for, say, half and hour?
it was a powerful air.

i no from around here.
i'll be right there.
in school.
i forgive you.
oh really?
mmmmm!  mmmmm!

we could call anonymously from a pay phone... just to see if there was an accident.
guys, guys! come on, if this is anyone's fault, it's mine. i was the one who grabbed trip's jacket by mistake. it's my fault and i apologize.
it's will, the really funny good looking guy you met at the bar?
did you think it was going to be easy? you think he was going to lay it out at your feet?
front armor is gone! just slow it down a little!

hey - i'm getting married in the morning - i already gave up drinking. one crutch at a time, doctor.
johnny! where the hell have you been?
so tell me why i shouldn't make this place off-limits.
all right, get out.  both of you.
it's you i was after all along, lucy.  to be our day time guardian. i knew if we could bring sam and michael into the faimly, there'd be no way you could say no.
all right.
no.
we think nlr.  we don't know! alonzo only fronted as a broker for our guys to make the meet.  he wasn't deep into the crew.
fine, dixie. fine.
'a connecticut yankee in king arthur's court' by mark twain.
you still feel that crazy...?
okay.  let's assume he wanted you to find him, that some part of him hated what he was doing... most likely, that part is dead.  schizophrenics with whalen's infraction sever all ties with the real world.  i'm sorry, i really am.
i say that feeling compelled to do the opposite of your parents is as enslaving as emulating them.
no.
then you better start swimming.
i've, uh...gotta find, gotta get a phone number in my desk.  i forgot to phone mel kaufman.
oh, would you...?
pull up alongside.
you overslept?
you can't back out on me now.  we need to be sure.
..."ignition propensity?"  ...you understand any of this...?
yes, you can.  come on, shelly!
no, i'd better not.
you have to ask like that?
leave him alone.
i'd rather read, thank-you.
it sure is.
oh, i am, baby, believe me.
shut up lloyd. you're not married yet.
well, if single-handedly vanquishing the enemy and slaughtering a whole nestful of termites makes someone a hero, yes i am.
six p-40's.
think of this more as a survival manual... there's our number on the back, and pray that you never need to call us.
you scots have a way with game.  it still has life in it. spirit.  back home the food is so...domestic.
maybe she was hot for steve and killed them both in a jealous rage.
then we'll go home.
huh?, sir.
because his mother got sick - very sick.  he couldn't leave her.  he's a kind boy, maybe too kind.
i can hardly wait.
how dare he?!
seven fingers...ay-eh...seven...
ah yes. of course.  to the girl who waits.
i don't know.
no harm will come to the child.  you might even say it's a privilege.  he will be the vessel for the spirit of vigo.  and you -- well, you will be the mother of the ruler of the world.  doesn't that sound nice?
this is hardly a time for levity. i've discovered a serious error here in the accounts of your last play.
excuse me, sir...
sure.
listen.
139  continued:
son, peerless is your name.  now you might be one of these hollywood types, change your name and all that but peerless dothan is on your birth certificate.
so it didn't feel... weird?
then why don't we just get it out of the way.
about one to five years worth.
then -- those are not your own words?
this press we cannot control. americans, i think.
what difference does it make where she comes from?
you don't love me.
it's not that kind of job.
nothing.
you have a great future as a driver. if they don't arrest you first!!
it wasn't very good last night, was it?
you must really think i'm a square, a computer nerd.
'milk, milk, lemonade.  round the corner fudge is made.  stick your finger in the hole, and out comes a tootsie roll!'
take the men. i can finish alone.
that was my cd.  don't you ever touch a chinese man's cd.
i honestly don't know. try to sleep, baby.
that's right, sugar, find the grip that's right for you. then grasp firmly. the camera weaves past a five foot pink whale with a gaping green mouth leading onto a mini-green.
no shit.
that's my fault.  i get too worked up at these.  i'm very method.  you do know... that's not my name.
that's interesting.
it doesn't make any difference anymore.
he was?
what happened??!!!?
what the hell is happening to me?!
i said fuck you.
what's a moral orgasm john? tell me how it feels exactly.
so it's almost a retroactive decision. so i could, like, let's say, forget about her and when she comes back make like i just pretended to forget about her.
she almost sounds scared.
want to take it back?
now let me get this straight. the aliens paralyzed the colonists, carried them over there, cocooned them to be hosts for more of those...
don't bother, i can take it up myself...
you... you wouldn't want to spend the day with me?
he's one of the best fliers in the country. right now he's planning a trip to japan.
you were waiting for a line-up then, too. what happened with that?
well, you know now, so please tell me who you are.
she's at school.  we've tried not to upset her more than she's been.
do i know you?
[beat] i was dropped off.
the basketball team?
you can use my car.
don't move, hacene.
then kiss me quick...before you wake up.
you'd have to travel hundreds of miles through the wilderness.
it's nuwanda.
don't ever talk like that, fran! don't make yourself out to be cheap.
thank you.
what?
yeah, i know, they'll hate me immediately.  thank you.
you're allergic to hay.
carl can wait.
ummm. it's good.
yes. whenever... all right, look. whenever i see a man that i think is attractive, i wonder what it would be like with him, i mean, i'm just curious, i don't act on it, but i hate that i think that!! i wish i could just forget about that stuff!!
too big. how long until the ribbon arrives?
maybe.
why's that necessary all of a sudden?
it happened in australasia.  he checked in yesterday.  no family complications, no record he ever broke his neck.  as far as anybody's concerned, he's still a walking, talking, fully-productive member of society. you just have to get him off the pipe and fill in the last two years of his life.  excuse me, <i>your</i> life.
you see, they don't really know me.
wait a minute.  i had some licorice ice cream earlier.  you guys could be gas.  what if... i'm dreaming. can you do any neat tricks to prove you're not gas?
stop it.  are you saying my husband is defrauding me?
yeah.
the dude, actually.  is what, uh.
it's not a boat boat.  it's really a house.
fine--i'll be glad to.
the new queen lives.
thank you, thank you, thank you! i'll do that for you some time. that's very sweet. say listen, what did you say your name was?
sure. what do you want me to call you?
yeah, but you might wanna light a match before you go in there.  did you bring my bag?
me? no, no, no, 'cause i never shower in a public place.
what about... those guys... i might have...
yes, you may... but don't make any noise.
you mean the nature of this conversation?
boys? you say to me boys?
i quit.  hit my dinger and hung 'em up.
i flushed it down the toilet.
i said, sir--in my official capacity-- as an honorary gesture--i appoint you to the united states senate!
yes, i will.
my expertise.  is that i'm a journalist.
...takes years of genetics, pal, and a yale education... and the right tailor.
though nicer than most?
terminate with extreme prejudice.
you are . . .
what?
yeah, i'd say some weird things have happened.
who does?
let me show you something.
i want to talk about lieutenant dunbar. is this lieutenant dunbar?
any activity?
down from houston. i think he knew the girl before.
the premium leads.  yes.  i know what they cost.  john.  because i, i generated the dollar revenue sufficient to buy them.  nineteen senny-nine, you know what i made? senny-nine?  ninety-six thousand dollars.  john?  for murray... for mitch...look at the sheets...
your mother hasn't been keeping up the pool. if you wanted to you could...
a thousand.
someone has to do something.
papers--they all want me to sign papers.
do you know where he went?
buddy, it's not your fault, and it's not your decision.
no.  i don't think so--
well, it's not very plain.
a sense of proportion.
might i enquire after the situation, sir, given that i've seen of the french engineering from the ridge above?
i guess.
i'm such a loser.
we got to talk.
mister, i'm calling you out.
i need two hundred and fifty grand.
his wife. in room 645. then she shot herself. 
...twelve years.
it might be best if we didn't talk.
what do you read? what's the last book you read?
so then this isn't crazy.  it's a sure bet.
loretta, i can't marry you.
permission to evaporate, o'neil.
no, thanks. the fellows in the office may get the wrong idea how i found out.
where do you want it?  in the face?
in that event, we won't need so many supplies.
oh god, that's great!
all my dreams have suddenly collapsed.  we did have a lot of laughs together, penelope.
will you tell him?
would it?
there's nothing to forgive.
grave robbing is one thing -- this is murder.
you know the suspect?
then it's a respectable house.
we're coming!
oh yes?
we have no choice.
okay.
the other agent. he said he was here to do an inspection and later, when he got on the elevator with the other guy, carruthers, i saw him wearing one of our security jackets...
yes, sir.
would you like to say something about killing, colonel?
i'll tell you when.
yes, it is.
<u>he</u> does. here's your quarter, brett.
totally!
we don't have no paper bags.
this is mr. wallace in subscriptions?
it's interesting.
and you know why? because the company knows they can starve us out -- even if it takes another two, three months. what's it to them if the mine's shut down a little longer?
that's correct.
and all the time he's apologizin' to the cat, goin' "i'm sorry." bang, "i'm sorry." bang!
very sporting of you, clayton.
victor must've taken him.
but why?
hey, mr. graduate fucking thesis here was s'posed to be driving!
wait a minute, you thinkin' of getting in bed with the cowboys?
look, ma, come on out. really. i need to talk to you.
right now?
you're probably the only one who could carry it off.
i'd be safer sleeping with that snake.
like i was sayin' you don't look like no meaner than hell cold-blooded damn killer.
a few days ago.
just find them!
stop pointing your fuckin' gun at daddy!
i do hope he's all there ... if you take my meaning.  i would hate to see master luke develop a short circuit ...
candy. candy, over here.  hey, doc, time out.
it's for your cigarette.  i prefer not to contaminate my crime scene with micropollutants.
a planet in federation space...
...huh?
listen, i do appreciate your concern, but--
of course.  what are you suggesting?
you seem to know all about my destiny.
come where?
let's hope, because we're sure as hell not going to do any damage to them with what we have here.
would you tell her bobby's here?
what's the matter?
you?  don't make me laugh.  you can't take care of shit.  you've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  all you're good for is games... so far, what i got outta you is nothin'...
and?
we can't do anything till it's dark.
i don't need proof.  i know it.  send it out.
he says --
i can't.
cameron.
where exactly is it?
yes.
it will not happen!
my husband took the car. will you drive me home?
why not?
the show must go on.
you won't tell me who you are? you won't even give me a chance to help you?
i don't know either. i think i'm a very nice guy. i also think i'm a pretty smart guy in my own way.
is it her?  is anne in there?
what happened to your eye ?
how come serial killers have two names, but lone gunman assassins have three.  john <u>wilkes</u> booth. mark <u>david</u> chapman.  lee <u>harvey</u> oswald.
junior, you gigantic idiot, how are we supposed to get into the room if they pass out?
undead. right. sort of an ectocosmic manifestation. what a pisser. tell you one thing though, timothy leary will be jealous as hell.
but--
hey, don't you think a hair stylists got any interest in gettin' it on?
yes.
always the drugs.
why would they?
how should i know?
how?
where are you?  you're driving me crazy, waiting like this.  i want you in me now!
so much the better. i've got a pocket full of tapes.
you're going to the office?!
the way i figure it, it was them or me. i thought putting dodge up on that pipe was a nice touch? bought a little time. made it look like whoever killed those greeks was still around. but it's just us on this ship. us and your... spirit friends.
i know so.  he, them, they're not to be trusted.
call me at work.  we can arrange to meet properly.  i don't want this to be the last conversation we have.  i know what you're like.
who is that?
he lives here in washington, doesn't he?
let me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation.
and they think they are protecting my by moving.
logic indicates that is the case.
no.  can you drive me home?  i'll bring you back in the morning.
just an hour?  you should tell this stud to take more time.
well, i do have ballet practice. perhaps i can come by your house afterwards.  i can change clothes at your place?
nothing, huh, do you know what i'm doing?
yeah. grab one of the cards behind you. call that number. it's my cell.
decent?  i guess any guy could be decent--if you were interested.
she made a play for me after i got back, but her glass eye kept interfering with my concentration. every time we got into a clinch, i'd start thinking about that hole in her head, that empty socket with the glass eye in it. an eye that couldn't see, an eye that couldn't shed any tears. the minute i started thinking about it, mr. johnson would get all soft and small. and i can't see getting married if mr. johnson isn't going to be in tiptop shape.
don't deny it!
i got to, mama. i know daddy wants to see him.
charlie called at eleven thirty looking for you.  you were with her, weren't you?
no! well, well, well! that's all right, if you like it. can anybody do that?
then you've gotta ask him about that.
done what?
sorgen sie bitte dafur das die gepack sorgfaltic behandeldt warren!
no...
the way they talk to each other. you can tell they're buddies.
of course you have a case! now, i want you to go with my assistant, iris, and fill out some forms. she'll tell you about our fee arrangement.  mrs. finley? any back pain since the accident? dizziness? nightmares?
that was the order, mr. sulu: clear the bridge.
it is quite late enough.
hey, remember?  you don't need my help, madmartigan.  little rabbit trap like this?  come on!  i could open it for you, but i wouldn't wanna insult you!
whose shoe?
something happened. because your eyes? are very cold? they're very cold, josh. they're cold, lying eyes.
maybe you'd like to tell mom and dad why you stopped taking your medication.
i don't think so, detective ...
thank you.
yeah. she's so little, so pretty, and innocent.
was rose.
why?
too late... there's something i must do...
you don't want to show your whole soul -- ugly, mis-shapen, and pitiful -- you don't want to show it --
it's possible that a burst of gravity waves escaped from the core, distorting space-time. they could be what hit the lewis and clark.
like what?
johnny's c.d.?
it bit me! my leg! jesus, it's down there, shoot it! shoot it for christ's sakes!
--i'm trying--
you wouldn't want me to dig up flynn's file and read it up on a vdt at the new york times, would you?
he's close...
venice...like katherine hepburn in summertime. . ....why can't i be katherine hepburn...
no you're not –  you're glad, because now you've got a witness.  i heard the other police talking last night.  they don't seem to like you very much.
bedrock!  i cannot dig any further in zis direction!
i am unlike any lifeform you have encountered before. as an android, i am in complete control of my neural net. the information contained there cannot be forcibly removed.
she was european!
why don't we both forget about him?
i'd rather go to viet nam.
no, no.  johana is visiting me.
oh, captain, they'll always make lingerie, it's one of the three basic needs of man -- food, shelter, silk teddies.  miller dream on, private.
to rise so high, in so short a time, is a dangerous occupation.  a little hypocrisy goes a long way.
the formality of a trial would be too costly for them.  they're beginning to understand that it's the ensuing news of our actions that incites support.
there.
yes.
it would appear so.
oh god, oh, god, no, i...
what you were saying.  keep talking.
oh, now, i'm afraid that's been exaggerated some--
mister, i don't want to know your name.
heart. give magua new heart.
fraid not. it wouldn't fit him, anyway.
doctor heller?
i do renounce them.
<u>we're gonna find the body</u>, johns. christ, you're a cop. why am i tellin' you this? we gotta go down and find it.
yeah, i think a woman.
what you wouldn't do. it's almost sunrise. it will be the sun or the fire. you said they can kill me. the sun or the fire!
no, not yet.
i want to talk now.
who is this guy, anyway?
shut up and let me think.
i brought the girl remember?
he is dead!  by god's choice!  there is nothing to discuss.
you don't think i know?
and that is?
no, it has to be tomorrow. you won't get this many of them in here for another year. it'll be fine.
but this is not a matter which can be settled tonight, surely?
why, you wouldn't quit when you're ahead, would you?
one thousand?? that's an awful lot of oranges. you know there are pill, lois. i've seen them.
yeah.
is her mother still lying on the floor?
when i'm not honing my craft in episodic television i do double-duty as a voice coach.  not that her accent would have hobbled her progress.  not with that look.
i thought you were going to take him that night but...
they're gonna call, give me instructions for a drop. i'm supposed to have the money ready tomorrow.
it's bad enough that you are.  it's even worse that you can stand here and lie to me.
what?
mr. roebush?
all right, here.
yo, i know what you're thinking, that i'm one of those guys that keep coming up to her.
and those lies she's been telling?
what about?
meaning you were expendable.
it's a whale out there.
that book wasn't canadian!
it's okay, don't bother, harry.
is that why you came up here, christy? to thank me?
your daughter needs you.  go.
i'd be crazy to think my virtue, such as it is, was more important than his life...
if it's so important, why don't you just tell me?
ahm, look this is a very odd situation.  i'm a friend of anna scott's -- and she rang me at home the day before yesterday -- and left a message saying she's staying with you...
you will know, in good time.
as commander in chief, i have ordered our army to set up defensive positions along the us-canada border in anticipation of an attack.
david?  david watts?  can you hear us?  david!  daviiiiid!
she is kicking you out.
i'm a deserter, too.
but tex didn't -- he still thought -- !
nice drawing. did you do that?
i was hoping i wouldn't have to tell you.  dorothy is really my daughter.  you see, it was spring in venice, and i was so young.  i didn't know what i was doing.  we were all like that on my father's side.
will you shut up already?
yes i do!  it never woulda stopped, you know that.  jesse's always gonna be making mistakes and we'd be paying for them for the rest of our lives.
let me ask you mr. manager, do you notice a smell of cockroaches? if i were to leave this room, i'm sure i could find this smell. i know people who could cleanse it. but maybe it doesn't bother you? why is that? are used to this smell? not me, i need a clean room to escape it.
don't tell me where to work. i moved to new york to work for edward dowd. but i can't believe that edward dowd has nothing better to do these days than invoke exalted legal issues to get off guilty little --
other properties as well - here and in europe.  and vest holdings - in sugar, oil, gold, electronics.  liquid funds over eighty million.  tmpcssible to put a figure on it all. all yours now.
that's it?
isn't he here?
he's my brother.
then how come they haven't set the bail yet? that's unconstitutional.
we'll see...
dinner can wait.
what are you doing in my closet?
it was so cool. he didn't say a word. he was just... ready, you know?  and we didn't kiss or talk or anything. he just sat there and let me do all the work.
don't need it.
whatever you do, don’t mention italy. or politics. or baby buggies.  or edith piaf.
...i said, i like your hair.
hold on, jack.  what's the problem?
it's a lovely outpost.
i think i broke my hand.  you're fired.
i'm afraid so -- i can't compete with you physically. and you're no match for my brains.
bon appetit!
only part.  what else?  what did you think of his claim that he tied this girl to the tree and set fire to her because joan of arc told him to do it.
i'm replacing lazarro. nice, safe desk job -- just like you wanted.
it's not important.
you get the feeling he doesn't want to be here?
yes... probably he was renewed?
come on.  let's get going.
maybe you're using the wrong approach.
you're not going anywhere.
there are cops all over the place.
like when?
hollis. hollis mulwray.
oh, that's right. isn't that nice? i hope that girls knows how lucky she is, marrying no less than derek summersby.
pay me, and i shut up.
i promise.
yeah, sure, that sounds nice.
i know.  i'm really, really sorry, miss tate.  please let me keep the job... it's the only way i can afford to stay here.
the fireworks are about to start.
yes!
...that's fine.
i'm angry because i want a mother, not martha stewart.
hey, listen... i'll give you something else, kittle.  anything. remember... remember that corpse washed up on huntington beach?  it was never identified...
why?
well, what do you think we ought to do about it?
yeah, i know, that's why you had it ready. you thought i was fuckin' layin' it?!
there's blood on your shirt.  is that an integral part of your job?
yes.
if you want a ringside table, tell 'em you're one of the pall bearers.
yes sir.
two, three thousand a ki. two thousand ki's, your end is $6,000,000.  complex transshipments or dealing with containers, these have front- loaded costs we pickup.  for this kind of weight, the balance of 80% is when our buyer picks up the load.  transactions are offshore.  dollars or euros.  secure internet transfers.  we have lists of cayman and isle of man banks infiltrated by irs, to be avoided...  no transactions of cash or other banking instruments take place on u.s. soil...  that's the deal.
be quiet, you fat fool.  can't you see i'm praying?
yeah?
maybe we can make a deal.
well, the whole gamut. facts of life and all. some fatherly advice, because, i tell you, there's things happening that you're probably old enough... well...  for example, on the self-abuse front -- now this is important - it's not advisable to do it in the shower -- it wastes water and electricity and because we all expect you to be doing it there in any case -- and, um, not onto the linen, and not on your sister's underwear or any clothing belonging to your mother --
my horse doesn't work.
i 1ove you, rowan.  i've always loved you.  i only wanted to be in your thoughts. to bring myself into your thoughts - so i could be as we are now.
that they tunnel, magically, through any obstacle, defying the practical laws of physics, in order to end up together --
you always had a way with words.  i should be getting back.
of course you took the initiative.
you are an animal.
you don't like that you don't know how to play him.  he doesn't follow the same rules of politics you do.  that makes him dangerous.
all right. thank god. alan stayed awake, at least.
it's not up to you to save me, jack.
i can beat that.
pretty sure.
my shift ends at four, but i couldn't --
you don't know what you're doing.
i don't know. perhaps.
just be cool.
here it is, some advice -- do the hard thing.
but my penalty. i've got to have a penalty.
livingston, huh?
yes, fairly well. but i went to bed last night planning to do some thinking about a number of things ... instead, i fell asleep.
i have work, i can't leave.
if we don't look like we know what we're doing, then we may as well...
let me show you...
it adds up that you got yourselves the wrong guy. because i'm telling you. the krauts wouldn't plant two stoolies in one barrack. and whatever you do to me you're going to have to do all over again when you find the right guy.
our common heritage.  i am your only real friend, you know.  the only one who truly understands you.  i look forward to the day we meet again.  and i kill you.
yellow's a bad color for me.  i'll look green at breakfast.
i can't.
this is our first meal in this house, lydia.  why don't we all do our little private parts to make it a pleasant one?
why is your beard so funny? let me touch this.
they never burned witches in this country, they hanged them.
what, mason?
i don't know.  when you say it, it sounds crazy.  but what else could it all be?
i want him upped to brigadier general, and recomended for the d.s.c.
okay, joe...
i surprise you? now that's news.
i don't believe it is, no.
let it go, peter.  the animal won.
hold on a minute.  where you going?
you have it...
yeah, i definitely need to make you some cds. at least while my kid is hanging out in there.
not yet.
i could get promoted right out of here.
i never make plans that far ahead.
it's possible i was infected with the hiv virus at that time, but i wasn't diagnosed until several years later.
a forced joining of an artery and vein. must've happened when benes was hurt.
do tell. why drug related?
yeah?
like you couldn't believe.
go and ask him yourself.
do i know you? you look familiar.
oh, please!  when she ran onto the field in the middle of the game? was that the most out-of-it thing ever, or did i blink?
we all got plans.  i planned on seeing all my life.  i know you didn't plan on straying into town.
you ready?
..we only promote safe rubbered sex.
did it get him off, huh, watching them cut her up?  tell me, because i really want to understand.  did he jerk off to it?  you watch it with him, sit there giving him a handjob while you both watched... ?
where?
the targeting sequence should take about four minutes.
thank you.
i'm glad he's gone.  maybe he's finally found a place where he can be happy.
naw, nothing.
what does he want. the russian shithead. what do you want ?
stop busting my hump....
yeah. but.
no.  get to the crest of the roof and be ready to jump.
fasten your flap! all you newmeats gonna have to shape up fast and hard on this gang. we got rules here an' in order to learn them, you gotta keep your ears open and your mouths shut.
what have you been before today?
you still owe me ten bucks from last week, if that's what you're working up to.
i ain't got nothing against god. it's the people he let come into the world... lot of them should have been stopped at the door. what are you looking for?
this way?
no blood. as i left a neighbor, an old woman, waved to me. i went to her house. she has the little girls. they are safe.
sorry!
it's okay, bob, we're just rapping, my friends and i.  we actually agree on a lot of things ...
what's your location? i repeat, what's your location?
yeah.  it was great.
learning was important?
you found him -- but we're not open yet.
why not? why the fuck not?
i don't know. [beat] i thought i was crazy after you left that day. i died. i still think i could be crazy. but then i replayed that night in my head -- the parts of it i could remember -- and it was like...i don't care if i was, or am. i haven't felt that way in a room with someone my whole life. [beat] and when you left, all i wanted was...
look, can we talk in a minute? i'm almost done.
i'm working on it... i've got a few leads... it's just that right now i have, all these projects that take up all my time.
what home?
you need me, selena. i'm the only one who can save you from a terrible fate.
the question is, what happened to freddy's body?
you have a free tongue, captain hamilton.
i... i...
what?
i still like upstart the best.
how 'bout a backward hex with a three-quarter twist...?
i'm hardly that, mr. patel.
at annie's house. she's all right.
i am not pitiful!  i am the bridge to the Übermensch!
then i'll transpose.
let me see if i can get the doctor hold on one second.
yes.
my god. he's going after the nest.
yes, i've seen it before.
six.
mah baby! we're diggin' and dyin' but our boy luke is lovin' and flyin'.
suffer?  we're living in america.
but why?... what if it starts to rain?
like hell they can't.  they can reach right in with their damn white hands and turn you off and on.
it's not suicide if you're already dead. two...
yeah, i felt that way, too, when i first started, but now... the hours, the repetition... it's not all glamour and mall openings anymore. maybe i should've listened to my people and tried to make the crossover to nights earlier, i don't know...  ...i just hope it's not too late for me. god! listen to me, "me, me, me." it's so easy to get caught up in the whole ego cycle of this business and make it all about yourself. stop, right? that's it, no more about me tonight, i promise... let's talk about you... what do you think about me? i'm kidding... seriously, betty, i'm doing all the talking here...
well, no one ever spit in my face before. especially some cracker fuck.
we have enough for a shuffleboard team.  in heaven, shuffleboard is everything.  hitler plays shuffleboard.
then i better be on my way. don't wanna put you out no more.
and cannes was quite fun, quite; and we played baccarat and chemindefer and there was a nice little italian marquis quite enthusiastic for me -- but a young man can be so silly --
yeah -- well, i'm sorry i'm tying up jane, i didn't realize you two would be going this late.  sorry.
damn.  gonna be another hot one today. sometimes i don't even want to get out of bed. course don't want to get out for the cold one's neither.  then of course the clouds come in...
what numbers do you punch?
tell him i won't be able to see him for a half an hour.
well, seeing as you have so much luck with cars, buddy thought it might be better to bring two.  he got this guy he says you know from lompoc, glenn something.
are there any other shuttles?
of course you can. angle - grange in the gallery --  in darkness.  the running lights on his night-scoped, laser-sighted sniper's rifle which throws vague sprays of eerie red and green light.
who said anything about "loser?" where do you get this word "loser?"
i met him in new york.
bill.  come on.  the question.  the question you've been asking yourself with increased regularity, at odd moments, panting through the extra game of handball, when you ran for the plane in delhi, when you sat up in bed last night and hit the floor in the office this morning.  the question that is in the back of your throat, choking the blood to your brain, ringing in the ears over and over as you put it to yourself --
what-what-what-what's the matter?
don't be such a fraidy-cat.
you could knock on the door, you know, and i'd open it.
you think of everything, don't you?
only a few.  a few.  do you like 'em?
sure, anything but this english.
you gonna let me keep any of it?
anacott steel. buy it.
yeah.  he lived there.  and died there, too.
they must be broken. i'm hanging in my straps! we're inverted!
it's too big.
roger.
peanut...
sure.
they're nothing.  they're nobody. i want the cowboys.  all of 'em.  i mean to break 'em up, drive 'em out of the territory.
even if i got there first she wouldn't go with me.
he won't tell me, but i've got my suspicions. and i don't want any of that. don't keep her out late.
the deal still stands, our other thing.
that's the point.  i'd like to be bothered.
you and moore move the bodies and bury boyd with them. in fact, put moore in the ground too.
thanks, professor.
what?
making a living.
i do not think so. enterprise has disobeyed orders and harbors two escaped convicts. admiral donald will make certain all your ship-to- shore transmissions are jammed.
get a stenographer.
last thing i need is a reason to keep hacking.  this job's a fill-in.
i can tell, the damn thing just doesn't understand.
excuse us, fraulein. good night, signore.
sure, but the end was so sudden.
i saw this show once. it was about logging. i was home sick, there was nothing else on. do you know how they break up really bad log jams? you know, when they're really tangled... ?
i got eyes, don't i? how my not gonna see something like that?
but we want you back, bill.  mean- while, enjoy your party, celebrate, we'll attend to the nasty details. and mr. black, may we say thank you.
faith, betty.  but make sure it's your own.
she doesn't care!  she's not married any more!  she's going to have fun!  i hope you have so much fun you can hardly stand it.  dr. woodly--i hope you make up even better jokes about my father than the ones you've said so far.
he had of went nuts and did somethin'. they don't put you in there for just bein' a retard. they's retards all over the place that ain't in the nuthouse. do you know, frank?
okay, but it still doesn't mean it can't be over with.
i bet.
oh, i forgot to tell you. i registered as mr. and mrs. 
that's one thing i won't forget.  where's macaulay?  i ought to be starting.
you've got the utility systems walkthrough, right?
you did?  why? where were you? they said you left hours ago. we were worried.
okay.
because i took it out of your memory.
what are we going to do, take a taxi?
yes -- you are right, mary. i can almost hear the little blades of grass a-starting up -- all the seeds a-stirring underneath the ground --
what music?
everything is wrong.
'feeling'?  i feel fine.  how do you feel?
i need my bolt gun and an ice axe.
oh, no. just a little bowled over, that's all.
let me see it.
have you noticed that every time we start to talk about something serious you start to play games.
less than you would guess.  most days two to three assistant d.a.'s. a handful of police investigators.
just give me the keys.
i really think you're overreacting in this whole -
my father used to play the same fucking lotto numbers with these other guys in the pharmacy. the same numbers everyday for sixteen years. one day he gets pissed off, tells them he's out and plays his own numbers. they hit the lucky seven for one point two million.
i'm serious, dude.  you always seem to be on top of things, even when you're tweakin'.
yes, i presumed it was about him.
coke.
ohhh.  do you know the east village?
well, i hate you, too. no i don't. i love your mama. nobody understands what i go through. i'll leave. you bunch of freaks have fun. i'll call you tomorrow honey. i'm sorry. you can kiss my ass, really.  you ever hit me again you little bastard and i'll make you sorry your daddy ever squirted your little ass out.
what happened to boxing? i thought we made a vow.
no. never. you'll have to kill me.
hurricane knocked out our mainframe, so all we have are their dogtags. cadets raymond dunbar and levi kendall --
will you indeed, mr. torrance.
you <u>swore</u>!
we were just looking.
lunch for whitey.  something to munch on in case things get dicey.
i'm sorry. i didn't want to sound cynical. but isn't it better to look things squarely in the eye?
aw, you ain't seen nothing yet.
it's luke.  get under him.  slow down.  easy chewie.  line up your tracking system.  lando, open the hatch.
just mail it to the hospital.  mr. king, please. it's regarding an accounting problem. yes... correct... i know where it is. that will be fine. thank you.
you mean tommy.  yeah, on the weirdness scale he's about an eleven.  supposedly some scary shit happened to him when he was a kid.  messed up his head.  he's harmless, though.  probably just lonely.
it's a tough proposition, andy. you, you know, if i did it, i'd have to run it my way.
you call them...
wait. you can't go.
i told you ... i can't. i just -- it doesn't feel right anymore, you know?
right. and as far as household items: we can share the soap, but we'll split the cost 60/40. cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay as much as the other guy.  aren't you boiling in that outfit?
yes.
surprised?
i don't know.
good to see ya again, jerry. if these numbers are right, this looks pretty sweet.
we don't have time to look at a hole in the ground. we can make vegas in four hours. this one's got to be her.
i understand. tell doctor crusher to have a hypospray of lectrazine ready...
you've got your own tv show?
oh, you don't think we're going to stand by and let her get away with fireballs and bees, do you?
i heard it too.
oh, ten dollars—
yeah?
really, professor, i--
she eats him alive and he takes it.
i thought you said it was a nightmare?
vivian... the meter's running... cooperate.
i like hearing you talk.  if you feel up to a short walk, there's a place to eat around the corner. all the food in vegas is terrible so the place doesn't really matter. how does that sound to you?
oh, pretty good. they bitin'?
i don't gamble.
same difference.  if you love someone, it's your duty to save them from themselves.
terry— what's happening to you?
it's not about witches, goddamnit!
don't you agree?
like he meant it.
yes, jimmy
yes!
you mean hot lips? screw her.
tomorrow -—
i don't drink coffee, daddy. and this is not what we should be talking about.
you better make sure your old man asks her out, because if he doesn't, they may never have a first date. and if they don't have a first date, they won't have a second date. if they don't have a second date, they won't fall in love. if they don't fall in love, they won't get married, and if they don't get married, you'll never be born!
tish-i'm tee. what's that?
you know, i don't know if i could do this even if i wanted to. the gaming commission would never give me a license. i have at least two dozen gambling and bookmaking pinches on me.
yeah. it's time to beat the drum. you better wait here. he don't trust the white man.
murdered! by whom?
i had nothing to do with that, sir, and i resent any implication ...
he hadn't done anything ... he was good ... what have you done with his body?
you won't learn anything from them. they are only love letters. there are not many of them.
...am starting to get jealous. i read in the newspapers about the italian strike and riots in milan.  i hope you weren't...
i didn't know, there were two islands.
no. i never date outside my race.
really?  lieutenant?
well. you're not the first guy i wrote to. but you're the only one i kept writing to.
what pipes?
i want children, i want a family. but i don't know when.
i think i've killed him.  martin, my husband, i've killed him!  that is, i'm not sure, but...
sure, but...ten thousand dollars.  do you know what they...this movie is budgeted at fifty <u>million</u> dol...they're coming up here, offer us a measl...
a mayfair it ever i saw one.
bunkers!
oh my god, the others!
i want this to be a marriage based on love, trust and community property. that's all i've ever wanted.
i'm talking about - i'm not going out.
no.
isn't mr. lowery back from lunch?
i don't blame you.  so we'd both fuck elvis. it's nice to meet people with common interests, isn't it?
i prefer to think, more like the sagacious owl.
he's a cool guy. a real nice, real funny, real cool guy.
what about tommy?
move! or you die right here!
you call me in on my day off because some idiots have broken into local democratic headquarters--tell me, harry, why should i be smiling?
it couldn't be any clearer.
oh, you're the understudy, sort of thing?
the one with the v.p.l.
oh yeah, he's the real fireman.  who are you? just another probie working for swayzak --
no, not really. middle-class.
yes, it is.
unwritten rule of the sea.  we don't bother each other, stick to ourselves. ask anybody.
finish it!
yes, i slept with him but that was a long time ago.
they set a trap  they actually set a trap.
yeah.
how would you like your eggs, captain? over.
damn.
mr. bartholomew -- are you sure you know who i am?
i wonder if he's some kind of mutant.  that bear had to be surprised.
the only thing is... you shouldn't keep this in the house. we gotta put it in a bank.
how can i let you leave; how can i let you take my children away? don't you know me?  you understand, it's an impossibility.  i would never let it happen; no, never, not if it took all my strength, all my cunning.  but in time, soon, you'll feel differently.  you see, you'll be happy that i stopped you.  i know you.  you'll forget about this; you'll forget about the baby we lost... and we'll go on, you and i.
that's what i love about a small town. you know everybody.
shit! it's both of them. the first murders were to throw us - using the same names as woodsboro. but they've moved on- -they're getting closer to sidney. they're not looking for a himbry or a tatum to kill. they're looking for the new tatum.
oh... oh, i didn't know her very well...
and you fell for it, pete. it frightens me what i'd like to do to you.  who else knows about this?
it's not what is looks like. she's having a breakdown. help me get her to her room.
something i ate.
well, we do have data from honeycutt's sources, chief - but it isn't pertinent.
what did you say your name is?
your client is guilty. don't dick around with me.
scully --
what does this have to do with--?
i don't know, ma. i'm all knocked out. i think i'll just hang arounna house and watch...
"the fifth one this week"!
i did not call her mad.  i merely asked her if she was.  and i repeat the question.  are you mad?
he had business at the hotel, but he'll drop in for dinner.
your mother and i do not wish to be disturbed for three full hours.
a mistake... it was a mistake...
and what are you doing?
get the fuck away from my car.
have a security team meet me at deck four main elevator!
wait!... wait...
what's that supposed to mean?
yes, my lord!
she may be easy on the eyes but she's trouble, trust me.  hot run to two-oh-two sansomme.
get this goddamn thing off me!
when i was a mere spit of a lad on ferry street in dublin the nuns used to say to me, "nolan, don't be swallowin' ye words like fishballs. when you got something to say—  —talk with your mouth wide open," so if i'm loud don't blame me— it's the fault of the nuns!
right... christ i'm tired.  do me a favor and keep me away from the press.
that's really funny.
too many. and you've got a new guest. a movie star from hollywood.
just a kid.
she's unconscious, but they think she's going to make it.
whoever it is won't give up -- and neither will i.
it even kicked back -- once at you, didn't it?
please, call me alan. we try to cultivate a casual atmosphere around here...
cause you know goddamn well who i am.
where is friedman?
what are you going to do?
i know.
if the young woman truly loves raoul --
it sounds gay, but guess since you're a girl it's okay, huh?
nothing. i'm just at work and i'm wondering, you know your friend lena?
my god, did i say that? i don't believe it.
you can do that?
the least you can do is look at me, while i'm sticking this shit into your arm. forget the fucking case, one hour a day, and give me a little of your time.
well, you better move holden out of the way or he's going to get spewed.
curly, where's your car?
yes.
let 'em come. i'm ready.
you wanna make a deal with me?
i'm done talking. get out.
kill a dead guy?
she was handing out those watermelon slices. and i sat down over on the other side, and i watched her.
no.  i found something new.
what?
...you out of your mind? that's our child. are you out of your fuckin' mind?
...yes of course.
as balzac said...
then he stashed it somewhere, or he has an accomplice. we'll release him until his indictment, keep tight surveillance, and see if he leads us to your disc.
ah-hah. and how is it you hope to achieve this goal?
you might be let down. i'm not a hermaphrodite.
are you going to arrest me or talk me to death?
i can see kalen's point.
ahm - he's male.  he's english.  he's a doctor of er ... at least 2 things.  i think they would have mentioned if he was a blind dwarf.  or one of those guys who kills lots of people all the time.  i think we're looking at someone moderately normal here.
but i'm having a good time...
you're right, evan, i don't believe you.
you have spilled the blood of the innocents. now the world belongs to me... now begins two million years of darkness!!  and all thanks to you!!!
an eternal damnation.
jack!
might be all right.
or for some new nutcase to copycat the copycat.
i took the kids to my sister's.
are you george sherman?
that's what i said to my son. he said, there's always two kinds. the soldier villain who fights the hero with his hands, and then there's the real threat. the brilliant and evil arch enemy who fights the hero with his mind.
how do you explain the part about beauregard?
vince is getting desperate.  where is she, eddie?  where'd you stash her?
no...
because he has to reveal it in a court of law. it's on record, it's out. it's no secret anymore. so how can they restrain his speech or retaliate? it's out in the world...
i found him.
wonderful!
-- you can and you will, mr. carter.
and how's the diva doing?
let me talk to mickey.
forget the fee.  if i find butterfield, maybe we'll talk about money.  if i don't...  ...my gamble.  either way... i get to spend some time... here.
nykwana wombosi. 
turn on your radio!
well, this isn't really a party per se.
-- but you'll never be able to get it through the maze.
you know, i - i'm too upset right now. and - an end has to be put to this.
maybe it's better that way.
wouldn't have known you.
ordell robbie. o-r-d-e-l-l. r-o-b-b- i-e. 1436 florence boulevard. compton 90222.
you asked me if i would --
save your strength, captain, these people have sworn to live and die at my command two hundred years before you were born. do you mean he...  ... never told you the tale? to amuse you, captain? never told you how the <u>enterprise</u> picked up the <u>botany bay</u>, lost in space from the year 1996, myself and the ship's company in cryogenic freeze?
well, then...
get out.
first you want me to ask for directions, then you don't.  which is it?
szpilman.  good name for a pianist.
how did you--?
r was worried about you  you didn't even call. you're always on my case if i don't call..
this brother from my college.
we'll take it.
i couldn't let him interfere with my project.
you - you're going to fuckin' jail, buddy, you ain't getting away with this one!!!!!
that's great, forsythe, great. thanks.
are you?
well, we're...
sir, he's just gonna get in my way. if i'm gonna handle this situation...
i like a place with lots of life.
i'm numb.
no -- i wanted to be a professional hockey player.
what about you?  what happened to you?
oh, yeah. hey, little fellow –– you worry me. you got someplace to sleep?
whoa, cool your maples. over the bridge, past the peter pan, last house on the dead end. theo releases sid's hand. sid drops to his knees and cradles his damaged hand.
if we don't engineer a consistent causality it'll work itself out on its own, and that's almost always worse.  ellie, according to your physics none of this is possible.  a lot of it you're simply not capable of understanding, not yet.  no offense.
bodeguita del medio.  it's the <u>only</u> place for mojitas...
i'll handle it. i'll handle it. hi.
you know where she is?
oh, you gonna tell me the reason you lost all the goddam money i got in the world! let me tell you the reason, motherfucker! the reason is, your ass ain't worth a shit no more!
that's really sweet, ted, but you should save it for one of your books.
no, we don't have any animatronics here.  these are the real miracle workers of jurassic park.
nygma. edward nygma. you hired me. personally. just like i tell everyone.  well, we've never actually met, but your name was on the hire slip.
whatta ya mean? you ain't et today.
if any!
i've been swimming, merv.
vada there is no chicken bone stuck in your throat.
yup.
david!
you're not safe on your own.
this little thing says i can't.
everything about what?
oh, yeah, well...um...i was just calling because, well, i was wondering if you still remembered me, which i guess you do...
how much?
yeah right... you better go.
and what happens when all hell breaks loose?
what if i don't pay ya, bert?
find the father.  that should clear things up.
and you believe everything the authorities tell you.
i don't know... i guess i think about the deer... being out, maybe. i don't know. i think about it all. hell, i like the trees, you know? i like the ways the trees are, all the different ways the trees are too.
then a little nap--
no, you can't --
hey dwayne why don't you introduce him to your funeral parlor cousin?
at a dinner party -- about eight months ago.
he let the fucking cop out -- but he won't --
here, catch.
no i know ... i know i do ...  but it's always the same, you know? grill the bun, flip the meat, melt the cheese ... it never changes. it never gets any better or worse ...
but they're not here yet.  tell me about <u>you</u>.
hey, mister.  you gotta quarter for the juke?
so where's that leave us?
stan.
i told you to send it back.
actually--i'm not real ... hungry.
we argued on sunday. he went to work on monday and stayed in the city during the week, like always. but on thursday, when he normally comes home, he didn't. didn't call either. not till saturday afternoon.
okay, there was a tasting last night. but i wanted to get us some stuff for the ride up. check out the box.
well, thanks again.  this was really nice of you.
she threw up in her mask.  let's cut the bullshit.  say it:  she threw up in her mask.
so change it.
that's us.
that's a very wise deduction, general.
it looks like scurvy.
this is maybe worse than you and i are used to.  what i'm talking about, i'm talking about murder. among other things.
take off your top.
what makes you think i'm not?
you think my kids have enough to eat, you rat?
dan! arrest them!
and, what, i'm not serious?
you've made a wise choice. keep up the good work.
more than that.
no.
listen to me, my blood somehow... helped you.  it could help all of you.  we could find some way to --
well, it was a big deal. as late as...yesterday. or this morning.  but not anymore.
same business, guerrillas hauling two guys from the chopper... followed by men with american equipment...
if i had any idea what to charge you with or how to prove it, i'd arrest you right here.
well -- i could meet you at the theatre -- if that's all right.
yeah, i think so. what happened?
that's good thinking, baxter. next month there's going to be a shift in personnel around here -- and as far as i'm concerned, you're executive material.
it can be dangerous...
what do you mean?
we're here for the week. i'm shooting in osaka for a few days.
nexus designated zhora:  incept june 13th 2017, athletic conditioning, highly competitive, special abilities in the entertainment field.

she <u>realizes</u> -- it was not the fire which <u>hurt</u> him...that the <u>true</u> hurt was her. was her...
please don't tell me "you'll find somebody else someday." cause . . .  . . . well, you are a pretty hard act to follow, you'll have to admit that.  oh, i'll get by, don't worry about me.
you really think we hurt him that bad?
i am programmed to do so if certain conditions arise.
max never had many friends.  so much with the piano.  always keeping to himself, it's unhealthy...
waldos.
sure.
i wish i had better news. commander data attacked us in the mission scout ship yesterday. ru'afo and i have decided to send in an assault team...
shut the fuck up, jude.
it was beautiful. and getting better all the time.
peter's brother?  but --
well, maybe you're right.
i want to be the way i was before.
what...
just lucky i guess.
no, no. the three hundred is for you doing it to me.
with his sergeant.  a mr. hardy.
ed?
we're in fashion.
you were never thirteen, mom.
did she talk about him to you?
a new magazine! i never saw it before.
i guess not...
uh-huh. why?
when i needed to catch earthworms, i knew the best way to catch them was not to chase them. i had to draw them out.
a fine, for five hundred dollars.
oh, fuck you! fuck you, sam rothstein!  fuck you!
they're wise by now.  which is next, iron springs?  yeah, let's try there, iron springs.
let me guess -- 'father'?
skynet.  a computer defense system built for sac-norad by cyber dynamics.  a modified series 4800.
but she is not an enigma mother. everything that agnes has done is explainable from modern psychiatry. one, two, three, right down the line.
go out the north exit!  there's a hallway and a false wall by the greek vases.  run!
let's continue.
i know what it meant... and i'm prepared to make it up to you.  i will make changes; i can.  i can change; that i have learned, that i have the strength to change... and we have another child, a boy... and you'll forget the miscarriage.
let's just say i'm uncomfortable with the whole scenario.
no... no, please... you cannot...
what is the truth?
it's more than that.
no, you won't.
just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.
yes, there is.
call me mark, would you?  cause i'm gonna keep calling you sidney.
yeah - lets shove off.
that was cool, wasn't it? you know, i don't even know where that came from. i just opened my mouth and it came out. after i said it i thought, that's a cool line, i gotta remember that.
i don't care. i want to get away from back home for a while. i'm tired of that shit back there.  look at this place. it's made of money. you know what the best part is? nobody's gonna know what we're doin'! there's nobody here to see us! everybody's back home.
he's dead, all right.
yes. i do.
aw screw it...
-- okay, g'head --

nicky sends his warmest regards.
just...want to be ready when we do.
all three subjects are confirmed inside. call off the house-to-house.  okay, dennis, i want to explain your situation --
really?  i don't work with violent cases, i work with children.  but even a kid lies.  they love it when they get you to believe something that isn't true.  don't you think stargher would do the same?
you don't want to cut me down. 'cause i'll kill you.
oh right.  i mean, i am a friend -- i'm not a lunatic but -- no, you basically...
john doe, the one in the speech.
she was talking about... a "harvest of blood"...
gee, lou, i'm doing the best i can.
yes, of course.  so, golly, where have you come from?
i know, i know. i waited outside till she went out. she's a very nice lady, but we don't vibrate well together.
oh, hell. drink?
no, i'm fine.  i'm...  ... wonderful.  just walking down the street with you again.
come on, gal...
they're not talking to me.  saks looks right through me.  i ask him for some bodies, for the phones -- he's so encouraging: "you make that <u>your</u> little job."  condescending bastard.  helen, on your lists to call is san quentin.  daryll lee cullum?
why not?
take over the register while i'm gone, okay, jimmy? 
no, that's not it, jerry.
even if they could they'd be too shit scared. they have got no muscle; they're gutless faggots.
we're trying to repair doctor cochrane's ship. it's been damaged and --
sweet.
love you too..
no, she hasn't.  i think i hear a car.
our house always needs touching up.
a window onto the human condition?
for whatever reasons i thought you might be more receptive.
why do i have to keep looking at you?
howard.
i don't really know what you're talking about.
willoughby. john willoughby, long john willoughby they called me in baseball.
yeah. a bloody funny thing!
no, i wanna kill my boss!
i'll go. i don't mind. really.
yeah, but how do you know?
m.k. ultra was terminated in 1973. but not the research. it was renamed.  ex catcher.
i didn't see none.
you're sure of that?
a passenger liner. over.
well, i don't vouch for him.
he doesn't trust you.
its eyesight is worse than i thought.  it couldn't see us.  and it couldn't smell us through the glass.
come on, you won't have to get near the water.
my life is over.  go.
pass.
out!
yeah.
wish i was.  oldest part of the system down there.  we're on it, but it's gonna take awhile.
you've made a considerably wise decision.
he must've unsealed the room!
correct, and that's when --
she's nosy.  she hears me on the telephone.
useless distractions.
well, in order to get started, there's just a few things i have to buy...  and some old debts i have outstanding.
not yet.
i was with jessie, she filled me in.
no, thank you.
a shower!?  did you take one, too?
aw, cut it out, will you? you'll get me thinking about charlie again.
there are others.
damn straight.
don't touch it.
to me hollywood is about death.
yah.
this going to work?
she's your wife. why don't you ask her? anyway, i assume she signed the highly over rated massey pre-nup.
oh, i know that! that's charming!  i didn't know you wrote that.
people done it. if they could, we could.
in the private aircraft hangar. anybody could have walked in.
here, have some.
she did not do it... please listen...
i see for proof positive you're the goddamn witch--
they did, admiral.
what have you left for me?
elephants! make way... i gotta get elephants!
just you wait until i'm foreign secretary. can't you just see me, freshie, with all those other shrewd, little foreign secretaries?  you see, the trick is to see who can out-talk the other. everybody wants something for nothing, and if you can't get it with smooth talk, you send an army in. i'm going to fool them, freshie. i'm not going to have an army. i'm going to disband mine. i'm going to sink my battleships - i'm going to destroy every piece of warcraft. then when the enemy approaches we'll say, "come in, gentlemen - what can we do for you?"  so then the poor enemy soldiers will stop and think. and what will they think, freshie? they'll think to themselves - "something's wrong here. we've been duped. this is not according to form. these people seem to be quite friendly, and why should we shoot them?" then they'll lay down their arms. you see how simple the whole thing is? centuries of tradition kicked right in the pants—  —and i'll be slapped straight into the nearest insane asylum.
there is some good in you, lex, after all.
about four weeks.
you're too weak, frank.  when you want something you have to do what- ever it takes to get it.  if something gets in your way you remove it.
wow. so you made love. ooo, i hear the birds chirping.
christ.  i never saw such a buncha old women.  you want me to fetch your slippers, hudson?
don't you remember?
well, there's not much to tell.
i'll get him.
i don't agree. i think we ought to stop and take a sample.
he didn't "find" nick's letters, did he.
oh...
...four, five.
relax, it's casual.
it is a terrible shock.
she was dirty and wet...
then why are you backing up?
i'm... i'm, uh, i'm robert redford.
you don't know how i've compromised my standards.
yes, you do!
hey!  now there's some good news.
we've always been here.
i thought i'd give you a hand since i kept you open.
hello, dana.  i happened to be in the neighborhood and i thought i'd stop by to see if everything's all right with you -- you know, with the blackout and everything? are you okay?  is the baby all right?
can't you listen to me? don't you want to get out of here?
maybe it's going to be a longer war than you figured -- eh, duke?
who's your boss?
someday, you may not mind so much.
oh, yes.
here i am, my angel.
this is the castle of of my master, guy de loimbard.
ah?!
you didn't stop anywhere else?!
laplante!
very well, jacques.
for vienna?
oh, i think we're going to have several.
yes, thanks.
not my place, sir.  it would only be a matter of time before i'm calling you dave.  then where would we be?  by next year, you're my sweety-pie" and i'm "coochie-coo".  i'11 be back in 15.
the legs must be goin'.
can you do it mike?
what?
where did you get the poison?
yes. i would like to be on that show.
what's wrong, scully?
naw, it's... i mean...
you're setting me up for a double cross, you with the ship, and me with nothing more than your word!
i... i was playing with fire.
possibly false. hence the ima record of being lost at sea. i don't think mutiny's out of the question here.
hiya, kid.
you bet, hon!
i just like dressin' up in these goddamn blue vests.  your money ticket get shipped today?
what do you think we're gonna do? he's probably got guys outside the fuckin' house!
where is it, sophie?
somebody stole it.
what room number?
yeah, but this is hard work.  can't talk now.
why do you hide in my room?
got a good buy in soap, miz cooper.
look, i will <u>send</u> a p.a. to pick up the children.  there are <u>agencies</u> that supply sitters, nannies...
no, i'm good.
don't give me that coffee, you rummy. now blow!
you're totally gone, aren't you?
lakeview the deli? oh, shit!
as a matter of fact, i do.
koessler?
so?
the woman has a new love in her life.  your friends are dead. nobody's left to save you, but me
you got any money?
yeah it turned out okay.  we applied for a national historical plaque for it.  that'll be the third one on main street.
who wants to know?  zeus!
no, you're not in trouble.  i'm interested in a murder.
yes, of course you remember it, but what you are remembering is merely a series of electrical impulses which you now realize have no necessary connection with outside reality.
lancelot, i will save you... don't die.
they weren't there. get close-ups.
there's one to every rule.
thanks, but... we've got plans.
right here.
i hope this was made with egg whites!
nothing i can't finish later.
she ain't in on it.
the holy grail, doctor jones. the chalice used by christ during the last supper. the cup that caught his blood at the crucifixion and was entrusted to joseph of arimathaea.
goddamn, goddamn! how did he die?
i see. was that all she said?
you know the jedi master?
later, man!!
no, jesse.  this isn't happening. it's gotta be everything you've taken in -- schneider and the diary and the glove -- only it's all mixed up.
we'd hoped to make it straight to san francisco, but we don't like the look of that sky. looks like a bad day coming... doesn't it.
is this some kind of joke?  gordo is that you?  are you fucking with me?
cynthia, i think you're laboring under a misconception. you seem to believe that because you happened to predict this, we should be impressed. we're not. anybody in any business can predict failure. 1 need people who prevent failure. i want to see this thing turned back in the right direction. remember this was your baby.
she told me you were a ghost in her life. daddy the friendly ghost.  coming back to haunt her.
out.
what did your <u>boyfriend</u> say when you told him you were moving to sherwood, ohio?
we were celebrating right after the draft, going from bar to bar.  i was drivin'.
jesus christ.  i get in a good mood.  how hard is it just to decide to be in a good mood, and then be in a good mood?
keep trying.
you're never going to believe this, but the canyon road...we were on it not two hours ago...well, it's completely...
it's me.
you gonna put it away?
no.  there is another chip.
that's not a laugh! i mean a laugh from the heart. now let's see. i'm going to tell you a funny story. just a moment... i've got it! well, it seems there were a couple of frenchmen who went to america...
just klaatu.
that's right.
i'll be at the bridge.
his testimony has the potential of blowing the lid off what's left of the la cosa nostra is this country. that alone warrants total immunity from prosecution and and a vanishing act with witness protection.
it's engineered to last about fifteen years.
sir?
you don't like it?
he bought you that?
here is why this fremen has taken service with me, to ask that one question. delay is as dangerous as the wrong answer. shadout is chakobsa... knife, in chakobsa is... maker of death.  it's a maker...
and what do you believe?
are you saying my mother had another husband?
what? nobody, i-
it's compensation, leo, for the marginal life we lead.  sidney, did you hear the story about the cloak-and-suitor who -- ?
i just drove in this morning.
something good --
he does work hard.
talk? once, at a gathering, he put his hand over a candle. and he kept it there. he kept it right in the flame until his flesh seared. a woman who was watching asked, "what's the trick?" and he replied. "the trick is not minding."
what?
you believe that?
pain? oh, no, doctor. i think if i had pain i'd be too happy to notice it...
some favor. i hope they know you're not like wendy.
that's all?
when?
margot!
48 hours. in 48 hours there can be no deals.
i don't know. special occasion. with the right person. it was supposed to be for my tenth wedding anniversary.
from nam?
i don't know, it depends.
i told you not to talk that way --
my ex-husband was a lawyer.
why should i?
that we should take our friendship a little further?
i don't love neddy.
you better get used to it. that bitch lazarro is getting kicked upstairs. guess what white-bread family man is going to replace her?
how old are you?
he killed a police officer.
what?
lighten up, dude. in those woods is some of the finest pussy in the school and we don't even have to buy it a hamburger and a diet coke. punch it in!
yes.
here. make it easy on you.
surrender yourself... surrender yourself...
hi.
you still want to go home, moose?
wait a minute -
i don’t know. he seems to delight in so much sisterly love, he might become determined.
i can imagine.
where where...
you've been coming in early.
i always wanted to go to madison square garden.  see the knicks play.
the little girl's name.
damnitt, monica.  this ain't about us anymore, it's about me.
buddy, what's come over you? a child like you, askin' such things.
must've...anyway, i ain't goin' back to look for it...
what do you think?
what for?
pass.
the big manufacturer killed baron von gaigern.
you're right, edward. i didn't mean to be impolite. please.
ahhhh...
i look forward to reading your report.
i can't do it even if he's gone.
let me tell you something.  listen to me.
who's there?
..in the building...
these days they they call me gregor -- and i'm a tech.  i do electronic work, surveillance, computer runs.
last time anybody saw this woman she was alive. you seem to certain she's dead.
good.  you believe this drunk?
oh my gosh, bud ...
so we've got problems.  everybody's got problems--that's normal--
maybe she's a slut just like her mom.
data, you're not thinking about using that thing are you?
good morning.
raw?
i can't talk about it. the work i was supposed to do... might have had some positive effect. i don't know... it could have been beneficial.  mostly, i got paid a lot. i took the money. my wife was happy. my kids had good medical. good schools. got a great house.  i mean, what the hell is wrong with that...?
yes, i know—but—
i can't believe you said that.
you did!!
why's that?
it's funny. sometimes i forget. then it hits me, and i can't stop crying.
the guy you killed was an off duty cop!  if you get out of here they'll nail you wherever you land.  they have a new thing called radar. maybe you've heard of it.
on screen.
clementine.
i'm having a drink, come on in, we'll have a drink.
where do you go from here?
and i realized, he's taking a chance too.
repairs ...
yeah. why are you asking?
radon leakage?
i saw mrs. windham standing over the body of mr. windham.
the butler did it.  guy was a cross between alistair cook and a cuisinart. dude took mr. ed and humptied dumptied it over gates's head.  he said it was made by, get this, leonardo..
mightier than the sword indeed.
long as it's fun.
plastic fucking surgeon?  you think i'm going to fix this, deirdre lass?  it's the mark of the patriot, and i'll wear it like a badge.  as for those who done it to me, i'll take my pound of flesh before this is all over.
pretty clever. are you game for more?
charlie's upstairs as sore as a pup. he's out fourteen cents, and he can't find it.
take your time.  don't worry about the elves.  they won't come out here.
something was there.  you saw it.
thanks. i hope you can come for the launching.
used to know a doctor who said he got to know his patients better than their wives did.  cutting a man open sure does expose more of him than pulling down his pants, gotta admit that.
yeah.
it was the biggest i could find.
i can handle it --
and you should.  your mommy tells me you've been such a good girl, and your daddy is so pleased with you.
no, it's all right.
we found a tunnel that leads to a temple below the palace! please, come with me, i'll show you!
don't have one, carl. i have a number, man. just like the numbers on those treasury checks. you stole from your own country, carl. shame on you.
this is agent james fujima.
i believe you.
what are you doing here?
very.
she was ...
i said welcome.
all i got is five. the rest is in the volvo.
no, that sucks.  how are we getting out?
what do you know, they moved it. catch you later.
poor dear... let's get you back in bed and i'll get them for you.
i'm always all business.
what was going on in there, how could she jump off the bed like that?
see what?
h'm?
probably safe in the hands of the federal government.
well, uh, my manager's gonna manage all that crap, or else he gonna get a coconut up his flue.
jesus...
they got that kind of money?
twenty-five by five, roll seven. and don't exceed port speed.
yeah -- you can really get hung up on them like the cat in the delta.
now that he's in the real world, there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality. sid is going to evolve.
am i missing somethin' here?
actually, my name is craig schwartz, dr. lester.
diet soda?
you're being terribly tolerant, aren't you?
yes.
it sure isn't the fun-fair.
i've seen it.
what of it?
crime of passion.
where's the place to go tonight?
show us a little more cooperation first.  where were you born?
aaron?
i'm terrible at this. i blurt. i'm a blurter. your parents...they ...well...they exist no further.  skinny-dipping. the amazon. piranhas. it wasn't pretty.
dean rusk!
never heard of him, who is he?
i really loved the skilful way you beat the other girls to the bride's bouquet.
you are an amazing lover.  you should be giving motivational seminars.
uh huh..and i don't suppose you got the name of this..perfect fare..
nothing. what could i do?
oh, god... kyle.  i need you so much.
yeah.
she started it. she started the whole thing. i'm just standin' here.
what??? you lose your lease on a condo?
pasen al-furgon v larguense de aqui! take the van and go.
your chauffeur's been waiting, baron.
no. i couldn't.
i'm not going -- you know i'm not going -- let me stay here?
oh, my god!  she's right! why did i turn off allison portchnik? she was-she was beautiful. she was willing. she was real... intelligent.  is it the old groucho marx joke? that-that i-i just don't wanna belong to any club that would have someone like me for a member?
yes, sir...troop's about ten miles back...the colonel sent me looking for you...
i enjoy it. does that make me some kind of pervert? just because a man has a rich imaginative life --
have some of the rat’s nest caviar.  from my own fishery.  they buy my caviar, drink my champagne, lose to my house.
just pull her -- down like inside -- harry, work with me here!
they refused to give me their names. their ranks are nine lieutenants, five captains, three majors and one fat colonel who called me a cheeky fellow.  their posts?  we picked them up here-and-there last night.
do...what.
i assure you that won't be necessary. we were only trying to help...
robbery's not criminal?
and you could be... sort of like... a father figure to me....
dream?!
i'm back here, aren't i?  so, you don't have to make up a buncha lies to make me feel good about it.
but they couldn't come out for a hundred years!
he is not cracking up.
oh, you'd be surprised. they just don't have their doctorates, that's all.
roper...
i have an idea....
are you sure?
oh, but she hasn't been here today. scottie whirls back on her.
excuse me.
'night, al.
i'm not asking you to set me up, jay.  that's not what i need your help for.  i want to know what it's like over there.
i want to call her and tell her i'm okay. that we're okay.
i don't know. is it?
oh!
she's in a kind of shock. i see all the signs of a post-traumatic reaction with possible dissociative symptoms.
but a morning newspaper, mr. kane. after all, we're practically closed twelve hours a day - except for the business offices -
i led no massacres.
do you have something around back, facing away from the road?
oh i love when you get all biblical satan.  you know exactly how to turn my crank!
yeah.
how serious is the damage?
why'd you go to harrison's?
you may think you know what you're talking about, kid, but believe me, you don't. you're talking about going into a battle you can never win on a battlefield so far above things like movies and hollywood that hearst won't even have to glance down when he crushes you. when he flicks you away with one finger. i'm talking about money and influence and evil beyond your capacity to imagine hell.
yeah, sure.
why shucks, lt. anus, you told me to get the fuck out of here...
i'm over here?  what's your name, officer?
waiting for andy.
madame, let me ask you: who is m'sieu laval, anyhow? where does he come from? what is he?
well, mr. fazeli, the bowling congress says i'm a thorn in their side.
has he?
keep it with you always.  you'll have more need of it than i.  it will bring the force to you.  you've already learned to feel it... now you must learn to use it.
sorry, pard. wouldn't want you to get an honor violation.
with all those holes nels pumped in i knew you wouldn't suffocate.
you know who it is.
that's disrespectful.
please, i want to wake up. leave me alone. it's not my fault you died; you were as good as dead when they brought you in--
i love michael...
the conference, oh yeah. fine. we reached an agreement and decided to divide up the world between us.
all right.
there's something i didn't have time to tell you before.
i see them. wait, leia!
yes. you?
i said get on your feet!
what do i have that you don't?
switch hands.
jerry - there's another problem.
trust me, claire.  you hear something... change the subject.  you find something... get rid of it, throw it in the lake.  you know what happened.  the rest is only details.  and no one's ever glad they got a hold of those.  if you want to put this back together...just let it go.
wolf-slayer, worm-sticker... give a cheer for the champion!
abby...
and you promised me you'd get your sweetheart to help!
i'm sorry.
that'd be swell.  you know, you're an awful lot different than i thought you'd be.
but, you told me yourself...
sometimes.
childs.
all of the above, man...  and then some.
you are!  i don't like you.
<u>well</u>, miss smarty, if i didn't go out, i wouldn't <u>need</u> any pants. now would i?
ed smythe, yes.
was the trip normal in every respect?
sometimes.
and sometimes you think you don't?! well, get away then!
because it's wreckable. i took another look and i changed my mind.
hey, i thought...
come on, phil, don't jerk me around.
what is it?
why?
i've never been to it.
got it.
i know and i thought i could handle it but work and pleasure along with somebody else, it's a dangerous mix.
what do you hate most?
sector four is secured, we put out the last three german one-fifty-fives, found them about two miles in from ponte du hoc.
sure. especially if you'd be a really terrific guy and bring me a cheeseburger to go --
i didn't follow you.
then you're of no use to me. i'm sorry i wasted your time. thank you for coming in, scottie.
no.
yeah.
no, keeper.
they know very little about the jurassic period they know less about the cretaceous.
no. no you said her body's been missing.
why don't you cut the cute act, danny, and tell me exactly what it is you're looking for?
sinatra?
um-hum ...
leave me be! why are you doing this? why are you picking at my sores... what is it that you want?... you want what? what's with you? i hope getting me thinking of everything that's wrong when all i want is to not do this has some purpose.  what is it, mom? no kidding.
you probably don't remember her, but louise bonner lives right over there in number 29. when she isn't drunk she runs a damn good acting class.
go out and plug the cord back in.
how?
you see, he'd been very clever. everybody, even our astute friend guild, thought that wynant was alive and that he was the murderer. but our hero had just one weak link in his chain.  the telegrams, wires and telephones were all very well - but no one had seen wynant. so he picked on poor mimi here to strengthen his case.  mimi is the only one at the table who can tell us who the real murderer is.  mimi, who was it that told you to say you'd seen wynant?
it's a vicious cycle.
that's it, you're looking at it, he just looks slick all day.
it doesn't work that way, kiddo. you don't know squat about the dynamics of marriage.
yes.
what for, dickweed?
oh, fuck, rudy... oh jesus...
why the fuck am i here?  i feel like i'm five years late for the prom.
no we didn't.  he died on his own.
it's going fine. the quiet riot and me are swapping trade secrets ...
ahh, vada, just put anything you want in the cart, anything at all.  i don't know what's gotten into her today.
i'll murder that lennon.
i thought it wasn't for sale.
wave that flag, hero.  keep dreaming those dreams.
it's made from specially-bred rabbits that live in the himalayas.
got a thick feelin' here.
that's right and i'll smash your face for you, yarblockos. slide of watch shop.
i am underground.
yes.
the ring up to him) what's a mourning ring?
yeah.
in cheyene walk?  lucy's going to have a meltdown.  oh, i'm so sorry.
major, i don't see how this line of questioning could...
dammit, will.  warfield had me locked up in his office again for five hours yesterday.  <i>five</i> hours.  asking all kinds of questions...
what of her bosom?
bone?  boom?  something bee.  i hire him while you were in the hospital.  he came cheap.
i know.
cora, in my heart, i know once we're joined, we'll be the happiest couple in england. let those whom you trust, your father, help settle what's best for you. in view of your indecision, why not rely on their advice and judgment as well as mine?
i'm going to...
yes, from the west.  he went undercover and and followed her here,
okay, sure. i might be tempted. especially now, since i'm getting out of the bail bonds business.
the walkers loved sean.  he was their only child...the object of all their attention.  i mean, wendell's a withdrawn sort of man.  that's his nature.  but risa, she's still got dreams.
very few, if any.
girl, lemme ask you somethin' and i want you t'tell me straight up, since i got my suspicions and y'know i ain't one t'talk circles... you gay?
oh...around...why?
but if it's him.  if he's really come back, won't he know us?  love us?
i never saw agnes until she set foot in this convent. my sister ran away from home. we lost touch with her. and when my husband died and i came here, she wrote to me and asked me if i would take care of agnes in case anything happened.
nothin'!  i told him he was great.
who put this dirty picture in buckaroo's viewer?
call upstairs, see what you can find out.
maybe he just got tired of covering for you.
the quiet...
she wants to make a deal.
and your mom.
we're not real sisters jamie, but that doesn't mean i love you any less.
perhaps.
if there were a leader, i would be the one.
goldilocks and the three bears?
oh, yeah, he's got things up and running, alright...
i got him in the stomach.
daddy's dead.
lloyd richards, you are not to consider giving that contemptible little worm the part of "cora."
what, what, i can't hear you...
both of you! get in the car!
you'd better get to bed yourself.
you've talked enough today, you're hoarse now.
obi-wan once thought as you do.
i can't identify him ..
you're taking mom out tonight?
no. what? no. i know.
yes!
sure.
back on earth.  victor's medical facility... we're in quarantine.
it's detonation cord, for a bomb.
the ship's depressurizing, the engines overheating. when it  reaches the core, we're done.
so we did that crackerbox... to cover for you.
of course, wes.
you already made the delivery?
a mister... seymour butts.
i don't wanna take your money, mr. masry.
are you kidding? everyone at school is always grabbing at my belly. i'm like a legend. they call me the cautionary whale.
we coulda had 'em for free, all we had to do was give 'em your sister.
ty and larry fuck with that shit, not me.
well... if you insist.
i don't know who they are.
fine.  but they'll have to take care of themselves.
what?
oh boy!
i should probably write that down.
apologies, my sweet.
me?
please get away from me.
what's your being married got to do with it?
oh, great.
good.  just keep telling yourselves that, the only people who can fuck this up is us.
i brought it for him to autograph. he's going to be amazed to see it - it's one of two known copies... i can't believe they have him for the opening act and not the headliner. what an insult!
your address?
i know that.
i didn't have the heart.
i did find him!
didn't you talk to snow?
i have a lot of money. do you know how much money i've got?
what do you mean, what am i gonna do? i'm in the same clothes for two days! i want to get a few of my things! big deal!
can you handle it?
what's that?
not yet. but i hear it's one swell show.

mr. liebkind, wait ...
oh, i don't know.  they'll clear all right.
i ain't blind, you asshole.
that's not a bad idea. how many episodes before he comes back?
since when do you talk like that?
we don't know that.
the one in the mine!
annie, i need a file.
you 'merican.  you don't know.
huh?
well, i have more than a few days, ha, ha... i uh... i'm sort of... not an editor anymore... right now... first time i've said it out loud.
what's he doing there? teaching?
had to take on another fire bare- handed, huh? had to be fucking myth man in there instead of looking out for your probie. is that what happened? is it, stephen?
strange activity.  i think they running drugs off tijuana.  day-day don't believe me.
come on over about half past seven, we'll think of something.  hello, ma, what's the matter?
not from you.

caintcha see it everett! them sigh- reens did this to pete! they loved him up an' turned him into a horney- toad!

and what does jennifer think's real?
i have japanese buyers who are looking to move a fleet, if you have the quality of merchandise they're after. and it's a mil two, max.
hey.
i want you to head right home after school.
isn't that the difference between a good cop and a bad cop?  a good cop can't sleep 'cause a piece of the puzzle's missing.  a bad cop can't sleep 'cause his conscience won't let him.  you said that once, remember?
won't happen.  i'm strong in my mind.
i think he's going to the john.
please, papa, i have a secret path.
look i don't even wanna know how i got in this mess. i just want out. it has nothing to do with me.

-- because irene threatened to put the dog to sleep if he didn't --
three days? i must be.
he's not a moron.
that's your name, isn't it?
sure.  too much birthday cake, right?
i've heard of you, too. you were in 124 with bargamian.

you look right through him. he's there, but there's something on the other side of him that you want. it's all you want. and whatever's in the way doesn't matter.... then it's easy.
the post-vegas man.
catch that alert? that's him in the u-haul.
